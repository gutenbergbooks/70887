<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>“Seventy-five per cent. of the women of America
are married, and most of these have children.” It is
not conceivable that women entering into any other
vocation of life would think of undertaking it without
deliberate preparation. Motherhood is so precious
and wonderful that we fear to think of it in terms of
definite preparedness. We like to think that it comes
natural to be good mothers and that to study in preparation
for it or to analyze it might produce more
harm than good.</p>

<p>Let me use my own case as an illustration of how ill-prepared
even earnest women are for motherhood. I
was married twenty-nine years ago. I wanted children
with all my heart. My first baby came sixteen months
after I was married. I bought all the literature I
could find on my new occupation, kindergarten books
beginning with Froebel and ending with Susan Blow
and her contemporaries; I studied Spencer’s Education,
William James’ chapters on habit and attention, and
read biographies of great people. My first ambition
was to be a good mother, and I was eager to learn all
I could about it. My college studies for five years
were Greek, Latin, and higher mathematics, with an
occasional semester of botany, evidences of Christianity,
physics, etc. I do not remember hearing a reference
to motherhood during my college experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>I have had six children, four of whom are living.
Had I had the knowledge I now have, or know how to
get, it seems that the little seven-months-old boy could
have been saved. I was called a scientific mother,
my babies were fed regularly, put to bed regularly,
and were dressed as sensibly as babies are now, but at
that time we did not have the knowledge about the
physical care of babies which we now have. What I
object to is the amount of time I had to give when my
children were little to learn things which I ought to
have known before motherhood came to me, so that I
could have been free to give myself to them. I knew
“education through play” only as a figure of speech.
Last summer I took a year-old baby to camp. I had
the care of her three consecutive months, and was responsible
for her six months. I yielded to the impulse
to play with her, and in gratifying this instinct I
used all the store of knowledge which experience had
brought to me. It was evident that she was learning
things every day, and that progress was astonishingly
rapid. Most of the things I taught her were taught
by the use of signs and objects. I asked her if she
wanted to come to me by holding out my hands to her.
She understood, and soon asked me to take her by
holding out her hands to me. I asked her where her
eyes were, her mouth, nose, ears, by touching each in
turn. She understood and touched each in turn. It
was interesting to note when it was no longer necessary
to use the sign, when she understood spoken language
without the aid of gesture.</p>

<p>The phrase that “education begins at the cradle”
took on a new significance. I felt that I was a teacher
as well as a mother and the importance of my part in
the education of this baby opened up amazingly. It
was play, but it was also education. Those minutes
with her when no one was near, when we were all
in all to each other, were precious beyond words.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
Through this love-relation there was intense joy in
both learning and teaching. The reason the mother’s
part in education is incomparable to any other is
because of this love-relation.</p>

<p>We are told that during the first five years of life
more is learned than during all the rest of life. The
teachers during these years are primarily the mothers.
The mother-teacher relation goes on after school
days begin, but gradually is regarded less important,
and the teacher’s part grows. Mother is forgotten as
a teacher. She loses confidence in herself and forgets
that no one can take her place.</p>

<p>It does not seem to me that any woman could have
more earnestly desired and striven to be a good mother.
I studied and worked as hard as I could, but it was not
possible for me to secure the training that girls can get
to-day. It now seems to me that it is about as rational
for a woman to learn by experience with her own
children to be a good mother, as it would be for a doctor
to get his education merely by practising on his patients.
Motherhood offers no less opportunities for success
than do the professions of law or medicine. The preparation
for it is just as definite and is more important.
It has remained for Mary L. Read, with splendid devotion
and university training, to put these matters
together and to organize and conduct a “School for
Mothercraft.”</p>

<p>The time is coming when women will no more go into
physical and spiritual motherhood unprepared, trusting
to “mother instinct”, than they will go into law
or medicine, trusting to their sense of right and of
sympathy with the sick to guide them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>Certain definite ideals have been constantly in mind
in the preparation of the present volume, among these
the following:</p>

<p>To write a handbook that is so definite, concrete,
and clear that the least experienced person of average
intelligence will find it practical.</p>

<p>To bring directly to those who have opportunity to
use it,—the home-makers, present and prospective,—some
of the wealth of present knowledge in biology,
dietetics, hygiene, domestic efficiency, child psychology,
education, that is stored in the laboratories, research
reports, medical records, technical journals, and educational
classics, translating these from the obscure
tongue of technical language into the clearer speech of
daily life.</p>

<p>To furnish a guide to more technical or detailed
consideration of each subject.</p>

<p>To present fundamental principles and facts rather
than mere rule of thumb procedure, so that the reader
may act intelligently and make intelligent variations.</p>

<p>Not to compromise on half-way procedure that merely
prevents disaster, but to make clear the means to greatest
personal efficiency and social power.</p>

<p>To keep a progressive yet reserved attitude between
conservative and radical theories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span></p>

<p>To bring the spirit of sympathy and humanness, of
love and child-nature and poetry into the teaching of
home-making.</p>

<p>To lighten the burden and enlighten the minds
and hearts of earnest young people so that with joy
and satisfaction they may essay and find the home and
family life that their hearts desire.</p>

<p>Froebel outlined, nearly a century ago, a thorough,
practical training course for young women, preparatory
to home-making or to vocational work as teachers or
mothers’ assistants. At Pestalozzi-Froebel House in
Berlin, half a century ago, under the administration of
Frau Shrader and Miss Annette Schepel, such a course
was organized. Echoes of it to-day are found in the
German secondary schools and special schools for
girls. The same idea spread to England a quarter
of a century ago, and there to-day a score of special
schools, and some girls’ high schools, provide such a
training.</p>

<p>In America, the School of Mothercraft was opened
in New York City in December, 1911, to work out
experimentally a training course for educated young
women.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Here has been developed a comprehensive,
human, practical course including domestic science
and art, and the care and training of babies and little
children. The students work in a home atmosphere,
under home conditions, using the household for their
practice work, caring for the resident babies and children,
educating and training them in the course of the
day’s régime, and receiving their own training in
personality and technique as well as in theory. Extension
classes have been maintained for young mothers,
brides, and engaged young women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span></p>

<p>It is work with young women and the children in the
School of Mothercraft that has made possible the
preparation of the present volume.</p>

<p>No book can take the place of the living teacher. No
amount of discussion of theory can be a substitute for
experience. Yet experience, without sound principles,
is also of minor value. Any book presupposes a modicum
of common sense and rational judgment in its
readers.</p>

<p>In a volume of such limited compass only a few significant
principles can be presented, and some of the
important elementary facts and technique that more
technical books may overlook. The present volume
aims only to be an introduction to the many phases of
home-making, child care, and child training, to furnish
something of vision for these responsibilities, and a
guide for further study.</p>

<p>No book can be a substitute for the personal advice
of the physician, the hygienist, the psychologist, and
the teacher. The reader of any book on applied science
may easily make the mistake of interpreting statements
out of proportion to their significance, or of misunderstanding
directions so that they even become misleading.
Only discussion with the living teacher will
discover and correct such errors.</p>

<p>The reader must be open-minded to new discoveries,
new theories, new methods. At the present time, as
never before, extensive researches are being made in
biology, hygiene, dietetics, child psychology, and pedagogy.
Important discoveries as revolutionary as the
discovery of the circulation of the blood, radio-activity,
the cellular basis of life, may be made at any future
time.</p>

<p>In the present volume no attempt has been made to
present controversial points of view, but a consistently
constructive régime and programme has been given.
The novice in any art must first learn to work constructively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
and rather dogmatically, until he has
learned to apply one set of principles efficiently. Then
he may begin to modify details according to some
rational principle, instead of by mere whim, and to
compare his method with other possibilities. The
basis and the special authorities for the régime here
presented will be found in the final chapter on bibliography.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The word “mothercraft” was coined by the author to express
the comprehensive scope of the training. The word has since
come into use in England in a narrower sense, including merely
infant care. It is hoped that in America the use of the word may

<p>Mothercraft is the skilful, practical doing of all that
is involved in the nourishing and training of children,
in a sympathetic, happy, religious spirit. It is not
merely the care of the little baby; that is a very small,
though significant, part. Its practice is not dependent
upon physical parenthood, but is part of the responsibility
of every woman who has to do with children
as teacher, nurse, friend, or household associate. It
is no more an instinct than is gardening or building.
It is not merely being with children. Its requisite
is vital working knowledge of the fundamental principles
of biology, hygiene, economics, psychology,
education, arts. It is mothering—that oldest,
steadiest, most satisfactory vocation to women always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
and everywhere—made intelligent and efficient
and joyous.</p>

<p>Mothercraft cannot be learned simply from books
any more than can music, agriculture, carpentry,
dentistry. The most important factor in the learning
of mothercraft is the daily intelligent association
with the children in their natural environment of
home. A hospital with sick children is a place to
learn its pathological phases.</p>

<p>No one of intelligence will dispute the <em>theory</em> that
the most important period in the child’s life is the first
seven years. It is in these years that the foundation
of his physical life is settled (or unsettled); that
the lifelong habits are formed; that the prejudices
and the bases of his spiritual and social life are laid.
The “gates of gifts”—his potentialities—are closed
at birth, possibly when his parents are chosen.
Whether one is an advocate of heredity or of environment
as the most influential factor in the life of the
individual, none will now gainsay that both the heredity
and the environment of every individual can be controlled,
and that each of these factors may be made
vastly more efficient through the high ideals, the
intelligence, and the foresight of parents present and
potential.</p>

<p>In these days of radical change in the activities and
education of women, mothercraft has not kept pace
with the other vocations open to women. In a society
where marriage is no longer an economic, domestic,
or conventional necessity, there has developed a tacit
assumption that youth would not marry, and therefore
special preparation for home-making (and especially
for child care) would be presumptuous and a waste of
time. The school has left this part of a girl’s training
for the home to give, and in a large proportion of homes
there has not been the time or the intelligence or the
foresight to give it. Girls have gone from elementary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
school directly into industry, or to high school and
college, or to finishing school and society. Educators
and vocational guides have frequently overlooked it in
educational and vocational conferences, exhibits, and
guidebooks.</p>

<p>And yet to-day in America, the care and training of
young children is chiefly in the hands of women.
Seventy-five per cent. of women in America are married,
and presumably most of them have the responsibility
of children in their own homes.</p>

<p>There are <em>ten million</em> children under six years of age
whose care and training is naturally in the entire control
of their homes. There are <em>fourteen million</em> children
between five and fifteen years of age who, on the
average, spend thirty hours a week, for forty weeks
a year, in school, while all the rest of their life—about
seventy per cent. of their waking hours, as well as all
their sleeping hours—is in the control of their mothers
and fathers.</p>

<p>Nursing, within fifty years, has become a profession,
and to-day it is almost impossible for a woman to find
employment as a nurse unless she has had a special
training for three years. Yet nursing has only to do
with sick folk, usually in a hospital, which is still a
far cry from the daily care, hygiene, and training of
the normal child in a home. For an equal period,
teachers of young children have been expected to take
a special normal course of two to four years. Yet this
training has had little to do, until recently in some
quarters, with hygiene, biology, or the psychology of
the child, but has concerned itself chiefly with subjects
in the curriculum and with masses of children in
an artificial grouping and environment, foreign to
their native interests and inimical to their physical
needs.</p>

<p>Only within the last twenty-five years has medicine
developed pediatrics—the special study of children’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
treatment. Child-hygiene is still later as an exact
science. Child-study, as an exact science, dates back
to Froebel and the early nineteenth century, and is
still a new field.</p>

<p>The mother in her home, herself with slight special
preparation, busy with her children, could scarcely
have been expected to keep pace with these developments
and to teach them to her daughters, even had
she the foresight. The higher institutions of learning,
naturally among the most conservative forces of
society, have not yet begun to perceive the significance
of such a subject as mothercraft in the curriculum,
although the beginnings of some phases are being made.
The secondary and elementary schools, bound by the
fetish of college requirements, are only beginning to
show here and there indications of efforts to prepare
for living instead of simply for college.</p>

<p>And the young woman—still immature, inexperienced,
and therefore not appreciative of life’s
values and impending responsibilities—has had neither
the guidance of school and home, nor the educational
opportunity, nor the personal foresight to prepare
adequately for this vocation.</p>

<p>What is the consequence? A generation of women,
the majority of whom are notoriously (and sometimes
shamelessly) ignorant and unskilled in the
most vital and significant human responsibilities. In
millions of homes women are wasting their time and
energy, losing the joy of their motherhood (and too
often their little ones), perplexed, harassed, over-burdened,
because they are bungling, stumbling
blindly, groping at their vocation. And those they
love most dearly are paying the penalty, in less happy
homes, less efficient lives. Hundreds of thousands of
self-supporting young women every year are going
into industrial or commercial work or school teaching,
not because they prefer it, but because opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
for acquiring the requisite skill are at hand, and conditions
of work have been standardized. Hundreds of
thousands of mothers with young children are seeking
in vain for assistants of desirable personality and efficient
training. For such workers there has been no
adequate opportunity for training and no standardizing
of working conditions. In all this, America is far
behind both Germany and England.</p>

<p>What does mothercraft require in its practitioners?
First, <em>personality</em>: love of children and sympathy with
child-nature, responsibility, patience, thoroughness in
the minute details day in and day out, self-control,
good judgment, adaptability, the play spirit. Fundamental
also are open-mindedness, spiritual vision, and
the poise that results from a well-regulated physical
régime and a firm apprehension of eternal verities.</p>

<p>Then <em>knowledge</em>: a sound foundation in the fundamental
principles and vital facts of applied biology,
psychology, sociology, ethics, economics, natural
sciences, play, arts, as they relate to the home, the
family, and childhood. Equally important is the
scientific mind that knows how to approach new problems
and receive new principles.</p>

<p>Then <em>technique</em>: the actual doing and practice of
mothercraft. Knowledge is of no value until it is
translated into efficient action. There must be little
children to care for, tend, play with, educate.</p>

<p>What of fathercraft? Every child has two parents,
equal in responsibility for his heredity and likewise for
his rearing. Fathers could hardly be expected ordinarily
to be versed in the intricacies of clothing, feeding,
and bathing the baby. But why should not every
man understand the principles of hygiene and foods
as a matter of his general knowledge quite as much as
for coöperation with the mother in the children’s
régime? Why should he not with equal zest make a
study of growth and development during childhood?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Even more, why should he not be intimately acquainted
with child psychology and the fundamental principles
of child training and education, that he may understand
his own children and coöperate sympathetically
in their upbringing? Is there any valid reason why he
should not be equally acquainted with the sociology
of the home, the meaning and principles of eugenics,
the psychology of harmony in home life?</p>

<p>There is no profession open to either men or women
that offers such opportunities for personal culture,
individual expression, technical skill, scientific research,
social contribution and welfare, as mothercraft.
Perhaps the very comprehensiveness of it
and its humanness have presented a problem so complex
that it has baffled the educators and delayed its
admission to academic dignity.</p>

<p>Through the channels of child welfare, eugenics, and
pediatrics, a keener sense of responsibility toward the
child unborn is developing. Through the increasing
knowledge of heredity, child psychology, and education,
a clearer vision is appearing to young men and young
women of what they themselves might have been, and
of what they may yet create and develop by combining
wisdom with their great love. Philanthropists are
realizing the futility of simply relieving immediate
suffering, crime, inefficiency, for generation after generation.
They are looking to the elimination of the
causes: ignorance of the rudiments of living, poor
heredity, neglect in childhood, unsanitary, ugly, unspiritual
living conditions. “There is no wealth but
life,” we are realizing with Ruskin. Statesmen and
legislators are beginning to see that the stability of
society and the State demand that the organizing of
homes, the founding of families, the spending of family
incomes, shall not be intrusted to novices and unskilled
workers. As indications of this, we have the recently
established Children’s Bureau, and the Smith-Lever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Bill with its appropriation for education that includes
home-making.</p>

<p>In America, clubs, reading courses, and special correspondence
for parents have been developed in the last
quarter century by the International Congress of
Mothers, Parent-Teachers’ Association, Home and
School League, American Institute of Child Life.
This is good and is helping many parents in meeting
their perplexities, but as a national means of vocational
training, its psychology and pedagogy is shortsighted
and inefficient.</p>

<p>What banker would trust his ledgers to a youth just
out of school, whose only special preparation for bookkeeping
was a current reading course in business
methods? What woman would permit a man to experiment
on her garden if he was just beginning a
correspondence course in agriculture? What business
man wants to intrust his correspondence to a stenographer
just out of a business course, even after months
of such vocational training? All this is recognized
as inefficient, wasteful, expensive in business; how
much more so is it in the home, where precious human
lives are the factors to be dealt with.</p>

<p>Slowly, but certainly, there is coming a new ideal in
education. Children and young people are to be
prepared for living. They are to know how to develop
physical vitality and mental ability and spiritual
power. They are to be prepared in spirit and intelligence,
in skill and in science, in personality and technique
for the responsibilities that most of them will
assume, for the greatest responsibility any of them can
assume—home-making and family rearing.</p>

<p>Both the school and the home are responsible for
the preparation of these future parents. They must
apply to this vocational problem all their knowledge
of psychology and pedagogy. Right habits of regularity,
responsibility, self-control, must be carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
trained in those babyhood and early childhood stages;
the manual phases of household work are to be taught
in the manual stage before the teens; boys and girls
are to be imbued with a wholesome, responsible spirit
toward motherhood and fatherhood and the home
which they are taught to look forward to as the goal
for themselves; girls in their teens are to have companionship
and experience with little children, learning
the essential details and the significant guiding principles
of their high calling in a practical, human,
motherly way, under wise and sympathetic teachers.
Girls, and boys likewise, will be encouraged to foresee
the significance and values and responsibility of home
and family, and to conduct themselves worthily of
such a mission.</p>

<p>Secondary and elementary schools are beginning to
give school credit for assistance at home. Domestic
science and art are now taught in hundreds of schools.
Their field as yet is narrowly restricted to the mechanics
of the household, usually taught in an academic way.
This, however, is an entering wedge for more practical,
comprehensive, and human phases of home-making
education whenever school administrators, teachers,
and parents shall see that vision. The day seems not
distant when colleges generally will give credit for all
home-making branches, as a few do now for some
phases. We may even yet see universities granting
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in mothercraft and fathercraft,
as well as in philology, astronomy, history, or
other more consequential branches of learning. College
alumnæ themselves are making earnest appeals to their
Alma Maters to prepare their students for home-making
responsibilities. It is not unthinkable that the colleges,
before many decades, might even include the
preparatory work in these subjects among their entrance
requirements, as they now do algebra and Latin. In
that day “applied science” will be esteemed more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
worthy than “pure science”, and ability to utilize
more honorable than ability to memorize. By the
next century, a mothercraft course may become as
conventional a part of the curriculum of a finishing
school as French or vocal training or æsthetic dancing;
and its rudiments as requisite as a certificate of age
for working papers; and preparedness in fathercraft
as stringent a requirement for a marriage license as a
medical certificate. Why not?</p>

<span class="fs80">ESTABLISHING THE HOME</span></h2>
</div>


<p><b>The Purpose of the Home.</b> The cause, historically,
and the reason, socially, for the home is the child and
the family. Home is the great training school of life
for parents as well as for children. It is not merely
a place to eat and sleep; any boarding-house can provide
that. The ideal home is a community of congenial
spirits, a place of inspiration, comfort, rest of spirit as
well as of body. Here dwell together two who have
chosen each other as comrades in the complex problem
of living, to share their fare, their mirth, their troubles,
to give cheer in distress, encouragement in struggle,
ambition for achievement, sympathy in trial and happiness,
friendly criticism to refine; and to coöperate in
their mutual desire, responsibility, joys, and trials of
rearing a family.</p>

<p>As young men and women face squarely the possibilities
in a home, as they perceive the causes of discord
in family life, and study the basis of family stability
and happiness, as they take the time before marriage
to compare sincerely their ideals, tastes, standards,
expectations, they will minimize the possibilities of
later discord—even tragedy. If they cannot agree
sincerely and heartily on economic, social, physiological,
and psychological adjustments before the wedding ceremony,
when each has the altruism of romance and the
spur of the game, how can they expect to adjust themselves
amicably afterwards, in the severe test of everyday
needs and situations?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Marriage is the concern of the individual, because
his happiness and his activity are involved. It is
also the concern of the State, because property rights,
social harmony, and future citizenship are involved.
A brief study of the historical and social development
of the home and family relations will give a surer basis
for the rational discussion of this problem than would
a theoretical discussion based merely on prejudices of
individualism or altruism.</p>

<p><b>Evolution of Marriage.</b> In the human species,
infancy is prolonged over several years. From this
mutual care by the mother and the father in primitive
society, there evolved the mutual love for the little child
and later for each other; and with this the permanent
relationship which alone could produce the organization
of the family. The beginnings of morality likewise
developed from this sense of a community interest
which called for a subordination of selfish desires.</p>

<p>For ages mankind has experimented with different
forms of family relation and home organization, trying
to discover which serve best to foster the child, conserve
the State, and satisfy the men and women who
form the family. Under different social and economic
conditions, polygamy and polyandry (more than one
wife or husband), promiscuity (several temporal husbands
or wives) and monogamy (one husband or wife)
have been tried.</p>

<p>Polygamy, in primitive society, developed where
women were in excess, or their labor increased family
income, or where a man’s fortune enabled him to support
more than one wife and her children. The
polygamous nature of man was accepted by Egyptian,
Greek, Roman, and Mohammedan religions, and its
practice permitted by their statutes. The Jewish nation
early evolved from polygamy to monogamy, and
incorporated the latter into its religion and customs.
Anglo-Saxon ideals were of monogamy. The teachings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of Christ emphasized monogamy. The early Christian
teachers even carried this, as other ideals, to its farthest
extreme, and preached the ideal of celibacy. It remained
for Mormonism to sanctify polygamy and
make it a duty. But polygamy, which was flatly
opposed by the general sentiment of the United States,
was short-lived in the territory of the Mormon Church.
The local feeling on this issue at present may be summarized
in the following sentiment, expressed by a
distinguished citizen of Utah:</p>

<p>“Our citizenship must be world citizenship. It is a
matter of common knowledge and comment that that
citizen is most valuable to his town who can see the
town’s needs in relation to those of his county; that
he is of most value to his county who sees that county
as a constituent part of the state and consents to nothing
for his county that would hurt the state; that a
state’s most valuable and serviceable citizen is the man
who has the power in his thinking, reasoning, and acting
to rise above sectionalism and act as a citizen of
the nation. This is the test to which our citizenship
must submit—the standard up to which it must
measure.”</p>

<p>In primitive, as well as in civilized societies, the
beginning of a new home is customarily celebrated with
civil and religious ceremonies; customs and laws provide
for the relative rights of the husband and wife to
their persons, their children, their property, and the
returns from their labor. Infidelity (particularly of
the wife), common-law marriages (living as husband
and wife without legal marriage), promiscuous relations,
divorce, have generally been branded as anti-social
and reprehensible, expressions of lack of self-control,
altruism, and foresight.</p>

<p>Mankind is finding through the experience of the
ages that monogamy best conserves child life, the home,
the State, and individual happiness. It has found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
that irresponsible parenthood, shallowness of marital or
parental affection, promiscuous relations, all endanger
the life and welfare of the child. It has learned that marriage
customs and laws requiring considerable formality
and therefore deliberation of the contracting parties,
reduced the proportion of hasty, unsatisfactory, and
temporary unions with their uncertain responsibility for
the children, and their quarrels over property. Many
factors have contributed to the establishment of the
really monogamous family and home as the social
ideal and the increasing social practice. The lengthening
period of infancy, with the consequent longer
period of mutual coöperation of parents in nurture
and training; realization of the Christ spirit of love
for others, of respect for the value and individuality of
every human life; the consequent refinement of the
emotional life and social feeling, and the sublimating
of sex instincts to the development of a richer personality,
to mental creative work and to social service;
the democratization of education and social status;
freedom in choice of a marriage partner—all have
contributed a part.</p>

<p>Freedom of choice has been far less prevalent than
capture, purchase, or family contract, in marriages of
the past. It is wearisome to even try to imagine the
procession of brides, since those early days of the
cavemen, who had no choice in the matter of their
husbands. For what countless millions of brides
was the marriage arranged by barter between their
fathers and their future household lords, sometimes
the father requiring a purchase price, sometimes the
bridegroom demanding a dowry. What millions of
girls have been selected while mere children as the
future wives and slaves of their husbands and the
family drudges of the household. How many millions
of brides and bridegrooms have never been consulted
as to their personal feelings or desires, but have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
married because the elders of their families decreed it.
Under all such conditions, if husband and wife developed
affection for each other, that was so much of
advantage to them from the combination; otherwise
they must adapt themselves as best they could to the
daily round of life in their common dwelling and
throughout their family responsibilities.</p>

<p>Trial marriages have been an experiment in many
societies. They are based upon suspicion and expectation
of termination, instead of upon that whole-hearted
confidence and expectation of endurance which
is the basis of a permanent relation. Psychologically,
therefore, their basis is false and weak. They presented
a crude method of testing mutual adaptation and
affection, which to-day may be gained by visiting a
few weeks in each other’s families, by thorough preliminary
discussion of problems of adjustment, and by
consultation with a competent physician, biologist, and
sociologist or a mature and thoughtful counsellor.</p>

<p>Thus has marriage evolved by stages from biological
matings, based on physical attraction; to the business
contract, based on economic relations; to the social
contract, based on social advantage to the family,
clan, or State; and finally to a spiritual relationship,
based on mutual social and intellectual interests and
ties. Romantic love as a general experience in marriage
has developed only during the past few hundred
years. No one of these phases—the biological,
economic, social, or spiritual—can be ignored in
marriage to-day without disaster, as divorce records
and daily observation show so clearly. To ignore the
higher relationships and base marriage simply on the
biological or material is to revert back to a lower stage
in human development. A marriage based simply on
physical attraction soon loses its glamour, and is as a
house built upon the sands. The enduring ties are
those of spiritual comradeship. It is this spiritual-biological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
love, evolving with the personality and soul
of man, that has inspired the great wealth of spiritual
creations in poetry, music, drama, and painting.</p>

<p>The American young woman of to-day, especially
of the middle classes, is economically, socially, and
religiously free to choose from among her suitors the
one she finds most congenial and whom she really
loves. Legislators are providing in many States for
the woman’s equal rights in marriage to her person,
property, and children. Churches, associations, and
parents are awakening to their responsibility in providing
natural and wholesome social opportunities for
young men and women to become acquainted. If a
woman does not find her ideal in the community where
she lives, she is socially free to migrate to any part of
the country, enter any one of a thousand occupations,
and seek until she finds a suitable helpmeet. In this
country, in contrast to Europe, there is an excess of
some two million men in the population. She will find
a large proportion of young men of her social class and
education, whose standards and habits of life are as
fine as Sir Galahad’s, who have the economic ability
to make a comfortable living, and who are ready to
coöperate intelligently and whole-heartedly in home-making.
The young man of to-day will find an increasing
proportion of young women who combine
physical charm, social gifts, intellectual comradeship,
home-making instincts, and preparation.</p>

<p><b>Why Homes Are Broken.</b> In a country where divorce
is easily obtained by either husband or wife, for serious
cause, the proportion of divorces is an index (1) to the
percentage of dissatisfied couples (which will always
be considerably higher than the percentage of divorces);
and (2) to the intelligence and forethought with which
young people enter marriage. The census of 1910 estimated
one marriage in twelve ending in divorce, and
counted as direct parties about one half of one per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
cent. of the population, something over three hundred
thousand men and women, with children involved in
about sixty per cent. of these families. The causes
stated in the court records would, of course, be only
those allowed in the laws as the legal grounds for
granting a divorce. These, in the order of their frequency,
were (1) desertion by the husband, (2) cruelty
of the husband, (3) desertion by the wife, (4) non-support
by the husband, (5) cruelty of the wife,
(6) adultery. The most frequent real causes, as found
by social investigation, are lack of self-control, lack
of mutual ideals in regard to sex relations, ignorance
of sex hygiene, use of alcohol, irresponsibility, economic
extravagance, disagreement regarding the family income,
hasty marriage after brief acquaintance. Among
the other causes productive of discord are selfishness,
insincerity, false pride, nagging, poor housekeeping, the
husband’s lack of economic ability; marked differences
in age, education, social status, religion; abnormal
craving for social excitement; unnatural, crowded,
unattractive homes.</p>

<p><b>How Homes Are Made Steadfast and a Benediction.</b>
The fundamental requisite of family happiness is love;
not merely sex attraction, which may be wholly selfish,
but love that is service, happier to give than to receive,
willing to share. In some respects similarity
between husband and wife is important in their social
and intellectual tastes, moral standards, religious
faith, refinement, love of children, rate of ability to
progress, degree of seriousness or frivolousness, ardor
and expression of affection. These make for congenial
daily living. In some respects complementary qualities
are desired. If one is impatient, the other may well
possess a degree of patience and sense of humor to
meet this; if one is extravagant, the other should be
thrifty; if one is radical, the other may well be conservative,
although marked extremes would always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
clash. The degree of positiveness in the one should
approximate that in the other; if equal, neither is
willing to yield; if very unequal, one domineers the
other. These complementary traits make for balance
of family life. The qualities that each should possess
would include responsibility, self-control, sincerity,
kindliness; freedom from drugs, conscientious abstinence
from alcohol and from vicious habits; a degree
of maturity and experience equal to the responsibilities
of home-making (usually not under twenty years for
women and twenty-one for men), love of home life
and of children; good health, freedom from any serious
germ disease, a family history free from criminal tendencies,
alcoholism, mental defects, tuberculosis. A gambler,
spendthrift, flirt, vacillating or superficial man or
woman, or one who is “sowing wild oats” has not the
qualifications for establishing a home. The man
should be able to earn a comfortable living, and the
woman to administer the household efficiently and
smoothly. Every woman should have some means of
making her livelihood at the time she marries; it
will greatly increase her husband’s respect for her and
be a source of confidence to herself. She usually
cannot do better, from the economic aspect, than to
become thoroughly skilled in phases of home-making.</p>

<p>How the family income should be divided, what
share the wife shall have for household use and for her
personal use, is so diplomatic and acute a problem that
it should be as sincerely and frankly discussed as all
these other phases.</p>

<p>Whether the wife should undertake work besides
managing the home-making is a moot question. Certainly
her first responsibility is to make a home not only
comfortable but inspiring. She needs to have such
opportunity for relaxation, meditation, reading, personal
development, that however weary and tense her
husband may return in the evening, she can give rest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
good cheer, and refreshment of spirit, because of her
reserve of vitality, and can send him each morning
to his work with the courage and good spirits stimulated
by her blitheness. She needs, also, to be storing reserve
strength for her children.</p>

<p>The location of the house greatly affects the family
life. Ideally, it should be a separate dwelling, with a
porch for outdoor social life, a garden where all members
of the family have room to work and play, with rooms
enough for individual privacy; and it should be owned,
not rented.</p>

<p>The minimum income on which two people may
advisably marry will depend largely upon their degree
of adaptability, patience, and sense of humor. Acquaintance
before marriage may safely be not less
than a year and preferably two, not only for thorough
and sincere acquaintance, but for the possibility of the
reaction and even repulsion that is so likely to follow
a violent case of love on short acquaintance. If love
is too ardent, it needs this discipline of patience and
restraint. If it is deep enough to last through the rest
of time, it will stand the test of waiting.</p>

<p>Having established their home, husband and wife
may well cultivate their love wisely, seeing that it
does not starve from lack of service in little thoughtfulnesses;
that it is not surfeited by too much of sweetness
or selfish expression; that it is protected by
residence separate from relatives, friends, strangers;
that both have individual social life and friends and
pursuits so that they do not become wearisome to
each other; that they busy themselves in some mutual
objective interest—social welfare, club, lodge work or
a reading course. The few minutes spent together
each day in gaining inspiration, either in religious worship,
or reading from some great book, or singing noble
songs, will do much to keep the family life harmonious
and to reduce the petty frictions. It is well to agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
on the first day—and carry through the agreement—that
if misunderstanding or the least suspicion arises,
it shall be frankly and thoroughly faced, discussed,
and eliminated, remembering that it is “the little
rift within the lute” that silences the music. Then,
as the poet sings:</p>

<p><b>The Budget.</b> Many young people hesitate to marry
on a modest income, either through confessed inability
to manage a small budget, or an unwillingness to begin
humbly and live simply. Many mothers are sorely
perplexed over the problem of finding time and energy
from their household work for the education of and
play with their children. Parents are perplexed over
how to provide for and educate more than one or two
children in what they consider a fitting manner.</p>

<p><b>Efficiency Methods.</b> The whole complexity may be
reduced to definite problems of philosophy, scientific
efficiency, physics, and mathematics. The first step
is to appreciate the relative value of life and of things,
of genuine simplicity and vulgar show; of educating
the children to share, to carry responsibility, to be self-reliant,
or to be selfish, dependent, luxury-loving.</p>

<p>Second, all the labor-saving machinery in the world
will but slightly reduce the output of time and energy
in the household work unless the worker will apply her
mind to the problem, adapt herself to new ways of
performing a piece of work, and be willing to think.</p>

<p>Third, the individual problem must be studied.
Have a regular monthly session to analyze seriously,
with pencil and paper, the household situation, and to
question every process of work and every expenditure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Can the household régime be made simpler yet socially
efficient? Where is there waste of energy, time,
materials, income? How can the accumulation of
dirt and dust be reduced? How can dishwashing and
laundry work be reduced? How can time spent in
cooking be decreased? How could any work be done
in a less tiring position? Where could there be a
reduction in the number of steps, trips, arm movements,
duplications of work, arranging which requires
later disarrangement? Where could pipes, drains,
hose lines, faucets, pulleys, speaking tubes, signals,
or other simple mechanical devices reduce time and
labor? What work could be done by a part-time helper
at an hourly or daily rate? What is the difference in
cost between food cooked at home or purchased already
cooked? What has been the loss from food
wasted, spoiled, thrown away, improperly cooked?
Could any foods be purchased directly from the producer,
with a saving of cost? Are the dealers sending
honest measures and correct bills? How could a reduction
be made in the cost of fuel or of lighting?</p>

<p>Domestic engineers, housekeeping experiment
stations, household efficiency laboratories already
exist, but they are so new that the terms are not yet
quite familiar. It may prove a great saving of time
and energy to consult one of the new domestic engineers,
whose business it is to analyze a kitchen or a house or a
family budget, plan its rearrangement for economy of
time, energy, and money, recommend labor-saving
machinery, or organize a system of routine.</p>

<p>Fourth, begin at once to put efficiency principles
into practice in the household work. Do not dawdle
or potter over work. Analyze the work of the household
into units, for example, preparation of breakfast,
laying and clearing the dining table, care of a bedroom,
washing the dishes. Specify the maximum amount
of time each unit <em>is worth</em>, then see how this can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
reduced, using the fewest arm motions and least
walking.</p>

<p><b>Saving Time and Energy.</b> Learn to plan and organize
work. Have a monthly, weekly, and daily
schedule of work. It will often be necessary to vary
this, but a well-planned schedule will nevertheless
reduce the time otherwise wasted in unnecessary duplication
and without definite purpose. “A stitch in
time saves nine.” This applies to sanitation, plumbing,
cleaning, gardening, colds, and sore throats, as
well as to socks and frocks.</p>

<p>Study how to eliminate useless motions. Make
exact studies, using a watch and a record pad. Observe
how many trips were made in laying the table,
and the length of time required. Discover ways of
reducing this by half, through use of a tray, more convenient
arrangement of supplies, fewer dishes, simpler
service. Make similar studies with other processes,
such as cleaning a room, or preparing a meal.</p>

<p>In an ordinary household, preparation of breakfast
for a family of five persons should not require more
than half an hour; lunch from twenty minutes to an
hour; dinner from half an hour to two hours. The
daily care of a bedroom should be completed in ten to
twenty minutes. Washing of dishes, clearing of
dining room and kitchen, should be finished in from
twenty to sixty minutes after a meal. The weekly
washing for such a family should be completed in
four to six hours, and likewise the ironing. Five hours
a week is enough to spend in baking, and only two
should be necessary if bread is not made.</p>

<p>Make out the menus for a whole week, revising daily
as necessary. This will assure better-balanced menus,
more variety, economy of time and money in marketing,
and will prevent the worry of unpreparedness. In
marketing, purchase a two or four months’ supply of
such staples as can be bought and stored advantageously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Have a regular day weekly to inspect
supplies and order staples. Have two or three regular
days a week for purchasing fresh vegetables, fruits,
meats.</p>

<p>The general architectural plan of a house, finish of
walls and floors, construction of windows, doors,
wainscoting, corners, mopboards, can make hours of
difference in the week’s labor. Even when the general
architecture cannot be altered, the floors may be improved.
Carpeted or waxed floors are the most difficult
to care for, while those painted or oiled are easiest.
Useless bric-a-brac, carved and ornate furniture, all
are dust and germ holders, and consume an extravagant
amount of time for their care. For every unnecessary
and useless piece of furniture, drapery, or
utensil, the housekeeper must pay a tax of time and
strength in handling. The Japanese have learned the
beauty of simplicity in house furnishing.</p>

<p>Rearrange the plan of the kitchen until supplies,
utensils, stove, water, sink are so placed that there
are fewest steps and motions, and it is as convenient
as an apartment house kitchenette. Tables, sinks,
and ironing boards adjusted to the height of the worker
will economize energy. A low stool to stand upon will
reduce the height of work tables; a detached wooden
frame or block on top of a low kitchen table or sink will
often give the desired height without stooping. A
cushioned stool or chair to sit upon while doing stationary
work, or a soft rug under feet while standing,
all add to comfort.</p>

<p>Electricity is the housekeeper’s man-of-all-work.
It can heat, light, cook, supply the energy for the
vacuum cleaner, washing machine, wringer, dishwasher.
In some communities it is now furnished at a
sufficiently low rate for such general use, and other
communities can have the same low rates whenever
the housekeepers organize and demand it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Simple cooking is more digestible, nourishing,
economical of labor, and, to a natural appetite, more
appetizing. The most valuable part of potatoes and
apples is next the skin, the removal of which before
cooking is wasteful of time and materials. A coal
stove is an enormous consumer of time and energy.
An alcohol stove furnishes the cleanest method of
cooking, quite practicable, with a fireless cooker
and steam cooker, for a small family. Next in convenience,
and more economical, are the gas or oil vapor
stoves. A good fireless cooker vastly reduces the time
required in the kitchen, and cuts the fuel bill in half.</p>

<p>In serving meals, labor is saved by using a tray, or
better still a wheeled tray with several shelves, which
may be drawn up to the table to hold the additional
courses and the soiled dishes as removed. A special
tray that will fit the cupboard shelf, to hold the constant
accessories, will save handling.</p>

<p>Dishwashing is an ever-recurring, three-times-a-day
problem. There are several fairly good dishwashing
machines now on the market, both electric
and hand-power. If dishes must be washed in the
old-fashioned way, engineering efficiency can be put
into it. After washing, scald the china in a wire basket
such as business offices use for holding letters, and
leave to dry without wiping, then place directly on
trays to take to the table instead of placing on shelves
only to take down again. In times of stress or of
picnic spirit, papier-mâché or wooden dishes will save
time.</p>

<p>For cleaning have a vacuum cleaner, carpet sweeper,
hair floor brush, dustless mop, dustless dusters or
cheesecloth dampened with kerosene, wax oil or
furniture polish. It takes an hour or two after sweeping
for dust to settle; this interval should be allowed
before dusting furniture.</p>

<p>If good laundries, guiltless of injurious chemicals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
and extravagant rates, are not available in the locality,
a coöperative laundry providing these features may be
organized and conducted by the women of the community,
as in many places in Wisconsin. If laundry
work must be done at home, an equipment of a good
washing machine or even a hand vacuum washer, a
wringer, stationary tubs, hose lines, running hot and
cold water, with sewer connection for waste, greatly
reduce the time and energy cost. A cold mangle or
one heated by gas or charcoal costs but a few dollars
and reduces by about seventy-five per cent. the labor
of ironing flat work. Gas or electric irons are inexpensive
and energy saving. Necessary laundry
work may be greatly minimized by providing silk or
cotton crepon for underwear and dresses, seersucker for
children’s rompers, dresses, and aprons, with doilies
or paper napkins in place of tablecloth, at least for
breakfast and lunch, and paper towels for kitchen
and bathroom.</p>

<p>The physical and mental condition of the worker
is a very considerable factor in time and energy cost.
Work attempted when one is fatigued, nervous, or
tense consumes vastly more energy and time. Learn
to relax at intervals; especially lie down for a few
minutes about midday. “Never stand when you can
sit; never sit when you can lie down.” If becoming
nervous or tense, relax completely, and take long,
slow, deep breaths of fresh air. Stand with the
weight on the balls of the feet, head erect and chest
expanded. Keep the house air in winter at efficiency
point: between 65° F. and 68° F. in temperature, and
sufficiently humid by well-filled water pans in furnace
pipe or by large open dishes of water in room, and with
a constant intake of fresh outside air.</p>

<p><b>Making the Most of the Family Income.</b> Analyze
the family income and spend it on paper many times
before spending it over the counter. Train the family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to spend less than is planned, rather than more
Ordinarily, for incomes up to three thousand dollars,
the following is considered by economists a wise distribution,
in a family with three children:</p>
<br>

<table class="autotable fs90" style="width: 85%">

<br>

<p>Personal ordering and selection of supplies, paying
cash and keeping accounts, will furnish the greatest
values for expenditures. Accurate scales and measures
in the kitchen, with occasional tests of supplies sent,
will check errors or dishonesty of marketmen. Cost of
supplies may be reduced by keeping posted on market
prices; buying in wholesale quantities where possible,
in coöperation with other housekeepers; buying directly
from the producer wherever possible; knowing the
reliable grades and brands of package goods. A
knowledge of the values of common foods and their
comparative cost for equivalent food value is indispensable
for efficiency. A reasonable allowance is two
dollars to two dollars and a half a week for food supplies
for each person. An ample quantity (eighteen hundred
to two thousand calories a day) of nourishing food of
limited variety can be purchased for one dollar a week.
Luxuries should be had on a four dollar weekly allowance
per person</p>

<p>The following table can be expanded by any housekeeper.
For other food stuffs: Note calories per pound.
(Given in Government Bulletin Number 28 or Rose’s
Laboratory Manual in Dietetics) To find the number
of calories for one cent, divide calories per pound by
cost per pound. Fruits and green vegetables, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
furnishing few calories for one cent, are needed each
day, for their vitamines, acids, and minerals.</p>

or suburb reduces the cost of living, as compared with
the city, (a) by reducing the stimulation and excitement
of daily life, and their energy cost; (b) reducing the
temptations to extravagant and frivolous expenditure
of money; (c) furnishing better air and more outdoor
living, thus increasing the quality of life besides
decreasing expenditures for illness; (d) providing a
porch and yard where children may play in sight of
mother at work, and where the family may find social
life; (e) providing space for garden and poultry, whose
care is healthful exercise, and whose products may reduce
the expenditure for food. By purchasing staples
at wholesale and organizing a coöperative marketing
group for fruits and vegetables, as wide a variety and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
as low a cost of food is possible as under most favorable
city conditions. The provision of rural traveling
libraries, art exhibits, educational picture films, the
use of the schoolhouse as a social center, the improvement
of education in the rural and suburban school
with its ideal natural environment, all are part of that
larger home-making for which every mother and father
should feel a responsibility.</p>

<p><b>The Value of Life and of Things.</b> “The things that
are seen are temporal; the things that are not seen are
eternal.” Do not mistake the means for the end in
housekeeping. Orderliness, immaculate linen, garnished
rooms are means. Good cheer, patience, kindliness,
reserve force, poise are of vastly greater value.
Often it is necessary to choose between the two.
Cherish simplicity, beauty, courtesy, rather than conventionality,
aping of passing modes, vulgar show,
and ostentation in the house, equipment, household
service, the clothing of the family. Train every member
of the family to be responsible for the care of his
own belongings and to wait upon himself as his share
in social coöperation.</p>

<p>Let the children from toddling time help in the
household duties and chores. It will be for their
guardians a good training in patience, adaptability,
and sympathy. What if their work is crude, with
many mistakes and mishaps? They are learning
motor coördinations, manual dexterity, a knowledge
of homely routine, the meaning of labor and service,
the joy of workmanship and creation, the satisfaction
of self-reliance, the happiness of intimate comradeship
with mother and father. Their character development
is the great consideration, not the materials they are
handling or the petty work they are accomplishing.</p>

<p><b>Solicitude for the Child as a Factor in Social Progress.</b>
The eugenic education of children is the real beginning.
Parents can give to the little children in the
home true ideals of parenthood, wholesome respect for
maternity and paternity, training in the control of
desires and appetites, a controlling sense of their personal
and social responsibility, and true instruction
regarding the origin and creation of life.</p>

<p>So to live that their children shall be strong and
happy is a motive that a child can appreciate, and it
can become the most powerful incentive for hygienic
living, for industry, education, for social purity that
is positive—noble in thought as well as restrictive
in action. Trained thus through childhood, boys and
girls will be prepared to meet with high-mindedness
and moral stamina the storm and stress of adolescence;
their ideals of sweetheart and lover will have a wholesome
eugenic prejudice, and they will be prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
to discuss with dignity, scientific spirit, and reverence
this significant phase of their future home life.</p>

<p>There is no essential contradiction between romantic
love and eugenics. Indeed, sincere, deep and enduring
love of parents for each other and for their children is
an essential in a eugenic ideal. A young woman knows
a hundred young men, but is in love with only one (or
possibly none) because the others do not embody the
ideal that she has fashioned. Every young man and
woman has such an ideal, perhaps only vaguely defined
but certainly felt, with which they are in love, for which
they search, and with which they sometimes invest an
acquaintance only to discover later their illusion. This
ideal is composed of the most alluring qualities and
personalities they have known.</p>

<p>What young man would be likely to fall in love with
a girl, however pretty, even charming, whom he
knew could be the mother only of sickly, peevish,
stupid children to inherit his name and perpetuate
his family, or who would refuse to assume the burden
of motherhood? What normal young woman would
be attracted by any “fairy prince”, however romantic,
wealthy, handsome, if she were aware that his children,
should he have any, would be doomed to early death,
weakness, or imbecility, and that she herself would be
made a sufferer for life? The widespread tendency
of young men and women of to-day to include beauty,
vitality, and ability in their romantic ideal is itself sufficient
evidence. Young men and women are generally
too well balanced to marry simply from eugenic consideration
without romantic love, although this is less
reprehensible than marriage simply for title or livelihood,
for social distinction, or personal creature comfort
without consideration for either eugenics or romantic
love. The prayer of Hector, as he lifted his little child
in his arms in the tower of Troy, while the battle raged
without the walls, is the prayer of the parent heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
everywhere, that the child shall be nobler and greater
than the father.</p>

<p>The normal biological life for every man and woman
is parenthood. The normal social relation between
parents is mutual, abiding love. Only through the
development of such a love has humanity evolved from
the materialistic, individualistic stage of the animal
to even the present stage of spiritual life and social
relationships.</p>

<p>It is mutual solicitude for the child that places the
biological relations of men and women on a wholesome,
ethical, and spiritual plane. Historically, marriage
and monogamy are the result of children. The social
stigma upon illegitimacy is not artificial or unreasonable.
It is the deep appreciation by the social experience
of humanity that parental responsibility and
solicitude is at the very foundation of society; that the
selfish, reckless use of this creative power, or a cuckoo-like
disregard for the child’s life, is undermining to
society as well as to the character of the man, the
woman, and their child. The far-sighted perceive, too,
that the undermining influence of physical relations
without spiritual purpose, of individualism that ignores
social responsibilities, of blind, unreasoning following of
any impulse, in this, as in any phase of life, is quite as
destructive to the man, the woman, and society, even
without the penalty of the unwelcome child; that
usually the man is more blameworthy than the woman;
that both are often the victims of ignorance, lack of
ideals, and of early training in responsibility and self-control;
and that similar selfish lack of solicitude for
their child is equally reprehensible within and without
marriage.</p>

<p>The child is the equal creation, responsibility, and
satisfaction of both father and mother. The parent
who willingly shirks the responsibility for the care of
his or her own child is a coward, if not a knave or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
defective. The father who would voluntarily forego
his share in the care and companionship of his child, or
the mother who would demand this, are equally lacking
in parental instinct.</p>

<p>Celibacy, marriage without love, parenthood without
marriage, are equally undesirable. But if circumstances
require a choice, celibacy is less miserable
for the individual and less detrimental to society. It
is part of the great social responsibility of parents and
social administrators to remove the causes of celibacy
by:</p>

<p>1. Providing academic, social, and moral education
that prepares young men and women for congenial
companionship and for home-making;</p>

<p>2. Making provision for wholesome recreational
opportunities and acquaintance, for young men and
women of similar intellectual and social interests;</p>

<p>3. Affording the economic opportunity for a family
income for young men by their early twenties, through
vocational training, regulation of the cost of commodities,
direction of labor conditions;</p>

<p>4. Abolishing war, that fiendish Minotaur that not
only interferes with Nature’s provision of an equal
number of men and women in any generation, but that,
more serious still, devours the ablest and strongest of
the young men, depriving millions of women of their
husbands and their children.</p>

<p><b>The Meaning and Significance of Eugenics.</b> Eugenics,
as defined by Sir Francis Galton, is “the science which
deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities
of a race and that develop these to their utmost
advantage.” Wise men in former ages have perceived
something of its possibilities.</p>

<p>Positive eugenics is concerned with whatever will
enhance the inborn qualities of a new generation,
therefore with social conditions that promote the mating
of the physically, mentally, and morally able; with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
conditions that improve the quality of the germ cells
in the individual; with ideals that develop self-control
and the spiritualizing of the instinct of race preservation.</p>

<p>Negative eugenics is concerned with the elimination
of hereditary diseases and defects; with the prevention
or correction of diseases, defects, poisons, and practices
in the parent that have a harmful effect upon the
germ cells and the unborn child; with the elimination
of social and moral conditions that endanger the life or
handicap the progress of unborn generations.</p>

<p>Genetics, the study of the laws of heredity, is the
biological foundation of the science of eugenics; ethics
and religion are the basis of practical eugenics.</p>

<p>In the past century great impetus was given to
eugenic research and ideals by Sir Francis Galton, a
cousin of Charles Darwin. Galton, indeed, coined the
word “eugenics” from two Greek words meaning
“well-born.” To quote from Galton’s own writings:</p>

<p>“Man is gifted with pity and other kindly feelings;
he has also the power of preventing many kinds of
suffering. I can conceive it to be within his power to
replace Natural Selection by other processes that are
more merciful and not less effective. This is precisely
the aim of eugenics. Its first object is to check the
birthrate of the unfit, instead of allowing them to come
into being, though doomed in large numbers to perish
prematurely. The second object is the improvement
of the race by furthering the productivity of the most
fit by early marriages and healthful rearing of their
children. Natural Selection rests upon excessive production
and wholesale destruction; eugenics on bringing
into the world no more individuals than can be
properly cared for and those only the best stock.”</p>

<p>Galton devoted his time and his fortune to the investigation
of these principles and the propaganda of
eugenic ideals. He made extensive studies of family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
histories, especially to ascertain what evidence they
gave of the inheritance of physical, mental, and moral
traits. He organized the Eugenics Education Society,
whose leaders include eminent scientists, sociologists,
physicians, educators, and under whose auspices the
First International Eugenics Congress was held in
London in 1912.</p>

<p><b>Present Knowledge of Heredity.</b> More has been
learned about heredity in the past quarter century
than in all previous history. Through the inspiration
of Galton, extensive studies have been made of family
histories in many countries, and not only has the
certainty of inheritance been established, but some of
the laws of heredity have been formulated. Through
the laboratory studies made possible by the improvements
in the compound microscope, important discoveries
have been made of the physiological processes
and the mechanism by which characteristics are inherited.
This is the summary of our present knowledge:</p>

<p>Physical and mental characteristics are inherited.</p>

<p>Inheritance is of definite traits, such as eye color,
height, musical genius, high or low resistance to a
germ disease, for example, tuberculosis. Research
work in genetics is at the present time especially concerned
with discovering what are the unit characters
and how each is transmitted.</p>

<p>Special cells, called germ cells, are the carriers of
heredity; these contain the determining factors for
physical and mental characteristics. These, like all
the other cells of the body, are microscopic in size.
The body of the individual is the temple in which the
sacred cells of the race are protected.</p>

<p>Inheritance is not directly from the parent but from
the germ cells, which may carry characteristics not
found in the parent but in some of the other ancestors.
An individual does not inherit what his parents <em>are</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
but what is in the two germ cells, one from the mother,
one from the father, that unite to form that individual.</p>

<p>With the union of the two germ cells the inborn
characteristics of the individual are determined, “the
gate of gifts is closed.” Environment and training
may increase the strength, or minimize the force of
inborn characteristics, or even suppress some of them,
but it cannot add to them, or increase their force beyond
their inherent limitations.</p>

<p>Some few characteristics are inherited only through
the mother, or only through the father, or are transmitted
only to the sons or only to the daughters;
most characteristics are not thus limited, but may be
transmitted by either parent to either son or daughter.</p>

<p>Acquired characteristics are not inherited. If a
man loses his hand in an accident, his descendants
cannot inherit one-handedness; if he masters a foreign
tongue, his descendants cannot inherit his knowledge
of that language.</p>

<p>No disease germ is inherited, in the genetic sense of
being conveyed in the special germ cells. A child may
be infected with a disease before its birth; this is not,
strictly speaking, heredity but congenital (or prenatal)
infection. Tuberculosis is sometimes thus conveyed
from the mother, and syphilis very frequently when
either the mother or the father has this disease even in
latent form. What may be inherited is a tendency
toward a disease, a weakness of specific organs or
tissues, a lack of resistance to a specific disease.</p>

<p>Variations sometimes appear apparently spontaneously,
as the result of some accident to the germ
plasm, or an unusual combination in the two germ cells;
such variations may be inherited.</p>

<p>Some characteristics are apparently persistent, and
in the process of inheritance tend to predominate over
their complementary characteristics. The former are
called dominant, the latter recessive characteristics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
The law by which dominant and recessive traits are
inherited was first formulated by Mendel, an Austrian
monk, less than half a century ago. Biological research
is being devoted at present to discovering what
traits of human significance are subject to this Mendelian
law, as it is called.</p>

<p>A characteristic found in both parents, or in both
families, has a double possibility of appearing in their
descendants, and some mental defects and abilities tend
to appear with greater force and at an earlier age, in
the descendants.</p>

<p>Every individual is born with all the germ cells he
will ever possess.</p>

<p>These germ cells are highly susceptible to poisons in
the circulation, especially to:</p>

<p>(1) alcohol, even in dilute quantities,</p>

<p>(2) fatigue poisons,</p>

<p>(3) opium, morphine, and similar drugs,</p>

<p>(4) lead and other poisonous metals,</p>

<p>(5) lack of nutrition due to anemic condition of the body.</p>

<p>If a germ cell is thus affected by poison at the time
of the uniting of two cells, or during the subsequent
development, the child is especially liable to:</p>

<p>(a) serious injury resulting in death before birth;</p>

<p>(b) low vitality resulting in death within a year after birth;</p>

<p>(c) defective development resulting in physical deformity
or in mental defect, such as feeble-mindedness
or idiocy.</p>

<p>If either parent is infected with syphilis, the germs
most frequently attack the developing child and cause
death before birth or during the first year; or the germs
may attack any tissues, crippling, producing deformities,
deafness, blindness, idiocy, manifest either at birth
or later in life. If either parent is infected with gonorrhea,
the eyes of the child will probably be infected at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
birth, and blindness prevented only by immediate use
of silver nitrate solution; or the mother may be made
incapable of having a child.</p>

<p><b>Fitness for Parenthood.</b> Even the minimum qualifications
for parenthood are various. For the fullest
welfare of the child the following qualifications are
essential:</p>

<p>Spiritual: a sense of the responsibility of parenthood,
love of children; love of harmony and mutual agreement
between parents; self-control, unselfishness, patience.</p>

<p>Social: legal marriage, good moral character.</p>

<p>Economic: marketable skill, energy, adaptability;
ability of father to earn a comfortable living, potential
ability of mother to earn a living, ability to use income
economically.</p>

<p>Mental: Maturity, experience, judgment to conduct
one’s share of the family and household responsibility,
ability to learn; for the mother, knowledge of
at least the elements of hygiene, child-care and training,
some experience in caring for little children.</p>

<p>Physical: physical and mental soundness; sound
heredity, especially freedom from neuropathic taint,
alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal disease (syphilis or
gonorrhea); freedom from poisons of alcohol, fatigue,
worry, overwork; mother not less than twenty or
more than forty-five; father not less than twenty, preferably
past twenty-four; maximum vitality and physical
energy.</p>

<p>Blood tests recently discovered make possible the
diagnosis of tuberculosis and venereal disease in the
system, even when no symptoms are obvious. It is
estimated that about twenty to thirty per cent. of
cases of venereal disease are innocently acquired,
through public drinking cups, towels, lavatories, toilets,
or by infection of the husband or wife after marriage.
Infection is usually acquired through sex immorality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
The certainty of a cure can never be made absolute;
the probability requires years of persistent treatment
by a responsible physician, not a quack. The man
who has “sown his wild oats” has verily sold his
birthright for a mess of pottage, and is most liable to
have acquired one of these loathsome diseases, habits
of drinking, and of self-indulgence. It is dangerous to
his wife and children for him to become a father until
all of these have been overcome. A woman who contemplates
marrying such a man to reform him is
inviting disease and destruction upon herself and her
children.</p>

<p>Some individuals should never become parents because
they carry so serious an hereditary taint which
some of their children would probably inherit and
carry on. This includes individuals afflicted with the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Neuropathic taint: feeble-mindedness, idiocy, insanity,
mania, epilepsy, hysteria, chorea, sex perversion,
alcoholism</p>

<p>Syphilis</p>

<p>Tuberculosis</p>

<p>Deaf-mutism</p>

<p>Otosclerosis (hardness of hearing due to rigid eardrum)</p>

<p>Catarrhal deafness</p>

<p>Retinitis (progressive degeneration of retina and
atrophy of optic nerve, producing blindness)</p>

<p>Albinism (absence of coloring in hair and eyes)</p>

<p>Inherent lack of physical energy; pauperism</p>
</div>

<p>If an individual with a family history that includes
one of these taints in hereditary form should marry an
individual having a family history with the same taint,
some of their children would probably be afflicted with
the taint, and others of them would carry it on. Marriage
of blood relations, such as cousins, is subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
this law; it is eugenically permissible, provided the
same hereditary defect does not appear in both family
histories.</p>

<p>The most advantageous years for parenthood, for the
welfare of the children, are between twenty or twenty-five
and forty years of age for the mother and past
twenty-five years for the father. An interval of two
or three years should elapse between the children, to
give ample opportunity for the mother to gain reserve
vitality and to care adequately for each child.</p>

<p>On the average, four children to a family are required
merely to maintain a constant population; families in
which the average is less than this are in danger of
extinction.</p>

<p>As soon as its far-reaching significance to themselves
and to their children is generally perceived by parents
and young people, men and women who genuinely
love each other will voluntarily give and absolutely
require a medical certificate before marriage. Before
undertaking the responsibility of parenthood,
both mother and father should put themselves into the
best possible physical and spiritual condition, and if
necessary, go through as thorough a course of training
as that of any aspirant for an athletic prize or of any
priest for a great spiritual work. The Vedas, the
sacred books of the Hindoos, contained special prayers
for those about to assume this creative work.</p>

<p>Nature has provided one effective, safe, and ethical
method of limiting the birth rate in the family, a
method that is entirely in the control of parents. This
method is abstinence, except for the end to which nature
implanted this instinct,—the creation of a new life.
It is conducive to the welfare of the children. This is
in no wise harmful to the physical, mental, social, or
spiritual well-being of men and women, if both are
temperamentally adapted to each other, mutually
agreed, and thoroughly honest with each other; if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
have learned to transmute this instinct and energy to
other activities; and if their recreations, personal hygiene,
and adjustment of daily living are normal and
wholesome, not artificially stimulating.</p>

<p>In conclusion, to quote from two English writers:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“By no other means than the realization of the ideal
that every new baby shall be loved and desired in
anticipation—an ideal that is perfectly practicable—can
the black stain of child murder and child torture
and neglect be removed from our civilization.”</p>

Let us put away childish things, stand up with open
eyes, and face our responsibilities.”</p>

<p class="right">—F. FROEBEL.</p>

<p>Children do not grow and develop by any haphazard
process. Too often parents have had so little, either
of first-hand acquaintance with other children, recollection
of their own childhood, or knowledge of the
literature of child-study, that they have fumbled in
the dark, misunderstanding and experimenting on their
own children, without either standards for comparison
or principles for guidance.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of material, both technical and
popular, available in this “century of the child.”
The impetus given to the study of the child by
Pestalozzi and Froebel a century ago has gained increasing
momentum in Europe and America. Some
investigators have made laborious studies of large
numbers of children to ascertain average rates and
factors of growth or development of some part of the
body or some phase of spirit. Others have made
painstaking, intensive studies of individual children
and have reported the characteristics observed at
different ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The outlines, main features, and basal principles are
already defined. A knowledge of these is as essential
to the intelligent worker with children as a knowledge
of the processes of plant growth and development to
the intelligent agriculturist. Many blanks and gaps in
our knowledge of child development are yet to be filled.
The father, mother, teacher who is sympathetic with
child nature, who has the scientific mind for accuracy,
definiteness and persistence of observation, has an
opportunity to contribute to the common fund of
knowledge of child life by making original observations
of the child in the home. Hitherto most of the published
studies, both of groups and of individuals, have
been made by men. Doctor G. Stanley Hall has been
the pioneer leader and chief inspirer of the child-study
movement in America. Doctor John Dewey’s contributions
and inspirations have been both profound
and extensive. Madame Montessori is the one woman
who has made large contributions.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a science of child-study and
development was not possible until the idea of evolution
became known and appreciated. Froebel sensed
this evolution, as will be noted in reading his “Education
of Man”, which was published a quarter of a
century before Darwin’s “Origin of Species.”</p>

<p>This phase of psychology—tracing the stages of
mental development as an organic process from its
simple beginnings in the individual or the race to its
maturity in adulthood of the individual or civilization
of the race—is the field of genetic psychology.</p>

<p>The intelligent worker with children in the home
must be acquainted with what is normal and usual at
any stage, in child anatomy, physiology, and psychology.
Only with such knowledge is it possible to
make intelligent observations of the development of
the individual child, and to supply a normal environment
and guidance suited to his stage of development.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Such knowledge and preparation can be acquired only
through study of the literature of child psychology,
and through intensive, first-hand acquaintance with
children.</p>

<p>It requires about twenty-five years for nature to
bring a human individual from birth to physiological
maturity. In the nine months before birth the growth
and development is very rapid. All the organs are
formed, but their development at birth is immature,
especially the development of the nervous system.

<p>After twenty-five years there is sometimes a slight
increase in height and weight; plasticity is slight;
new habits are not readily formed; new ideas not
readily accepted. The nervous system is capable of
continued development.</p>

<p>There are a few foundation facts and principles
that should be summarized before taking up in detail
the stages of growth and development.</p>

<p>The child is not a small edition of an adult. His
anatomical proportions, his physiological processes,
his ways of thought and of thinking, his motives, interests,
likes, emotions, methods of expression, are
all different from the adult’s; and they are all different
at different stages in his development.</p>

<p>The child lives through (recapitulates) in a general
way the main stages and order of physical and psychological
development that organic life and the race
have passed through in the countless ages since life
began. Starting as a one-celled creature, he recapitulates
in the nine months of embryonic life the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
processes of evolution that required millions of years,
from the amœba to the higher vertebrates, in the evolution
of the species.</p>

<p>At birth the baby is less developed and more plastic
than the young of any other creature at its birth. This
helplessness and plasticity are due to the incompleteness
in development of the nervous system. It is
because of this incompleteness that the physical,
mental, and spiritual life can be shaped in great measure
by environment. It is this incompleteness that provides
both the opportunity and the responsibility of
parents and guardians.</p>

<p>For normal development there must be both the
growth principle and power within the individual,
and the growth stimulus and materials supplied by the
environment.</p>

<p>The rate and nature of growth and development are
influenced by two factors: (1) heredity (race, family);
(2) environment (climate, social status, economic resources,
city or country, materialistic or idealistic
atmosphere, commonplace or cultured, ugly or beautiful,
expressive or repressive, guiding or neglectful).</p>

<p>Growth and development are two different processes.
Growth is increase in size; development is increase in
power of function. This principle holds true for every
muscle, every nerve, every special organ, every brain
center.</p>

<p>Growth is a vegetative process, dependent upon
intake of nutrition and elimination of waste. Development
is dependent upon use, which involves the exercise
of the organ or system and of the related brain center,
and this leads to both (a) the initial use of mind and
(b) mental development.</p>

<p>Each organ, each physiological system or process,
each mental process, is controlled by its own definite
nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain. By exercise
of the specific organ or system, the corresponding nerve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
center is developed; and the development of the nerve
center makes possible a more adequate and perfect
use of the specific organ or system.</p>

<p>During the growth stage of any part, exercise of the
part is not normal but injurious. When sufficient
growth has been attained for development to begin,
there is an instinctive desire or hunger for exercise
of the part. This desire is manifested by the natural,
spontaneous activity or interest of the child. For
example, during some ten or twelve months the muscles
of the legs and back, and corresponding nerve centers
in the spinal cord and the brain, are growing. When
their growth is attained, these muscles and nerve centers
begin to function in the process of standing and walking,
and the child makes every effort to walk. To put him
on his feet and attempt to teach him before this stage,
is to strain unprepared organs, bones, muscles, and
nerves. To keep him lying in a vehicle so he cannot
exercise when he spontaneously attempts to walk, is
to retard or prevent this natural development.</p>

<p>The process of growth and development is not uniform
during childhood; neither do all the parts grow
and develop at the same time. Growth is periodic and
by parts; it is variable for each part or system. There
are periods of slow or rapid growth and development at
different ages.</p>

<p>Development begins first for the oldest (racially)
muscles and parts, and for those that are being used
reflexly, that is, arms, legs, trunk, hands, which are
known as the fundamental muscles. The finer, accessory
muscles and their brain centers do not develop
completely until several years after birth.</p>

<p>There are no average children. Every child is
somewhat different. In rate of growth, children may
normally vary one to two years from the average. In
individual children, some factors at any stage will normally
be more marked than others. Distinction must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
therefore be made between (1) chronological age,
(2) physiological age, and (3) psychological age. The
standards for (2) and (3) are at present the subject of
special researches. Physiological age refers to such
factors as dentition, development of bones, height,
weight, sex maturity. Psychological age refers to
mental ability and maturity.</p>

<p>In some children the hereditary force of a specific
characteristic is stronger than in other children. Or the
environment of one child gives greater stimulus to an
instinct at its nascent (beginning) period, and greater
opportunity for its use.</p>

<p>The individual who lives most completely in each
stage the life normal to that stage, is best prepared for
the succeeding stages of life.</p>

<p>To attempt to hurry a child through this process
or to permit an arrest of development in any stage or
at any point, is to seriously handicap the child’s normal
and complete development. Infant prodigies and infantile
youths are both abnormal.</p>

<p>In each stage there are some instincts to be especially
fostered, some that need encouragement or stimulation,
some that require careful direction into useful channels,
some to be ignored as only transitory, and a few that
may need inhibiting.</p>

<p>The following group of stages has been prepared as
possibly most helpful for guidance of parents and teachers
in the home. The transition from one stage to
another is gradual.</p>

<p>In so brief a summary as the following, only a few
of the most significant items can be presented, and
these typical of the average. This is not a form into
which every child must be expected to fit. Rather it
is a suggestion of the usual, which the individual normal
child will approximate in general. It presents a
method for recording the development of the individual
child.</p>

<h3>Development of Language</h3>

<p>Children vary naturally, and according to their environment,
in the rate of development in use of language.
Any effort to hasten the process of talking or
vocabulary during the first four or five years is an artificial
forcing that is more likely to retard development.
The following represents all that should be expected
of a normal child.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First six months: crying, gesture language</p>

<p>Second six months: babbling, imitation of sounds,
gesture language</p>

<p>One year: three to ten words</p>

<p>One to two years: vocabulary of 100 to 500 words;
two-word sentences</p>

<p>Two to three years: 500 to 1500 new words; begins
use of pronouns</p>

<p>Three to four years: 500 new words; complete sentences</p>

<p>Four to five years: articulation nearly perfect; interest
in rhyming</p>

<p>Five to six years: articulation perfect; inflection of
nouns and verbs nearly perfect; interest in nonsense
words; use of drawing</p>

<p>Six to nine years: grammar usually correct; interest
in puns and in secret language; use of drawing as
language expression; imitative interest in symbols of
language (alphabet, reading, writing)</p>

<p>Nine to twelve years: genuine interest in language
symbols; easily learns reading and writing; with limited
vocabulary, slang develops</p>

<p><b>Prenatal Hygiene.</b> If any baby could supervise the
preparation for his own coming, he would not wait
until the last few months before his advent, that is,
any baby who had even moderate ambition for his
comfort, his happiness, and his efficiency.</p>

<p>He would begin by selecting his grandparents, who
would be high-minded, religious, abstainers, moderate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>in all their habits, industrious, neither wealthy nor
poverty-stricken, and who would bring up his father
and his mother as members of a family of children in
the same spirit and with foresight for his welfare. He
would direct, during their childhood and adolescence,
the physical régime of his father and mother, which
would be simple, natural, regular, chiefly in the open
air, with habitual deep breathing and, especially for
his mother, exercises and clothing that would develop
the most efficient digestion, breathing capacity, back
and trunk muscles, steady nerves, reserve vitality. He
would guide their education, which would include a
minimum of traditional junk, parrotlike mimicry and
discipline, and a maximum of real experience, valuable
information, and æsthetic appreciation acquired
through personal exploring, experimenting, judging,
creating, with a discipline that developed self-direction,
self-control, and self-reliance.</p>

<p>He would anticipate that his mother and father, with
such a heredity and education, would be high-minded
above dissipation and triflings, sensible beyond unhygienic
habits in food and in dress, well-poised and
superior to pettiness and discords, with a radiant love
that maintained an atmosphere of joyousness, graciousness,
courage. Having chosen each other because they
loved each other, his father and mother would live and
work and plan because they loved him. Before they
invited him to come, they would have a comfortable
home settled, so his mother could give her chief attention
to him and be free to live much out-of-doors; they
would consult their physician and bring themselves to
their best vitality, so he might have the best physical
constitution; and they would make any necessary
sacrifice of their own desires that he might be undisturbed
and thus grow steadily and sturdily until his
birthday.</p>

<p>Physical motherhood is a natural, normal biological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
process. Under a natural, rational régime it should be
a happy experience with a minimum of discomfort.
The essentials, in brief, of such a régime are:</p>

<p>1. Thorough elimination of the increased amount of
waste products, through the skin, lungs, kidneys, and
intestines.</p>

<p>2. Strong, flexible trunk muscles.</p>

<p>3. Avoidance of fatigue, undue excitement, unhappiness,
muscular strain; continence.</p>

<p>4. Simple, nourishing diet, carefully balanced, anti-toxic,
rich in minerals, moderate in quantity, with a
moderate amount of liquid.</p>

<p>The mother should of course be under the physician’s
direction and observation during the entire
period.</p>

<p><b>Clothing.</b> The essentials are freedom and warmth.
Maternity clothing need not be slovenly nor too obviously
negligée. Elaborateness may better be expressed
in the maternity clothes than upon the baby
clothes. For dresses and coats a design with fullness
at the sides, in the waist and skirt, with revers, and a
high waist line, is especially good. The materials
should be plain, or with a small, unobtrusive design.
Clothing should be ample enough to encourage rather
than prevent a slight perspiration, thus facilitating the
elimination of waste.</p>

<p>The weight of the clothing should come from the
shoulders. This is important in order to prevent any
downward pressure upon the internal organs, as well
as to allow for much deep breathing. It is possible by
having a one-piece union suit, a brassiere for attachment
of hose supporters, a combination corset cover
and petticoat, and a one-piece dress.</p>

<p>All the clothing should be comfortably loose, especially
any neckbands, sleeves, gloves, which may well
be a size larger, as there is a slight swelling during this
time. No round garters should be worn, as these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
impede the circulation in the legs and increase the
possibility of varicose veins. The ankles should be
well protected, because the blood vessels here are
very near the surface and easily chilled, and as the
blood returns from the legs to the trunk and internal
organs, internal congestion might result from
chilling of the lower extremities. Shoes should have
<em>low heels</em> to prevent falling and rubber heels to
minimize jars.</p>

<p>The corset is a moot question. The woman who has
not been accustomed to wearing one is most fortunate
now, for she has been developing and training the
muscles of the back and trunk, which should be strong
and flexible, equal to the special demands made upon
them during the last four months and at the birth. If
corsets have been the custom, it would be most advisable
to discard them three or six months before motherhood
is begun, and to give a systematic course of training
to these muscles. Some physicians require their
patients to discard corsets during this time. Their
only possible value is to support the back and the bust,
not as support for the abdomen. They may be harmful
by crowding the internal organs, pressing any organs
out of place, interfering with the fullest deep breathing
and internal circulation, keeping the trunk muscles
flabby and weak, compressing the breasts; and thereby
causing more discomfort to the mother, depriving the
baby of sufficient oxygen, making the birth longer and
more difficult, and hindering nursing ability. A
brassiere or comfortably fitted muslin waist is an
adequate bust supporter; or a knitted breast binder is
procurable which should be applied loosely enough to
cause no compression, which hinders the development
of the nursing glands. After the fourth month, the
baby rises from the pelvis to the abdomen and the waist
increases in size. Ordinary corsets then become
especially dangerous. If for any reason a corset is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
then worn, it should be a special maternity style, such
as the Ferris maternity waist. During the last month
or two, it is advisable to discard even this corset, and
if any support is necessary, to wear an abdominal
supporting band, a knitted, shaped band being especially
comfortable.</p>

<p><b>Food.</b> The careful regulation of the diet and food-taking
has vastly much to do with the comfort of the
mother and the sturdiness of the baby. All the nourishment
that the baby receives is derived from the substances
that the mother takes in food and drink, which
are digested in her system and conveyed from her circulation
to his. It is a mistaken idea that the mother
is “eating for two” and needs to increase the quantity.
No increase in her normal requirement for protein or
fat is considered either needed or desirable during the
entire nine months, or any increase in carbohydrates
until the last three months. The system cannot use
the excess, which thereby only makes a greater tax upon
the organs of elimination or clogs the system with
poisons and overcrowds the abdominal organs. Abundance
of mineral, especially lime, phosphorus, iron, and
soda is essential. During the last three months there
is an increase of about one fifth in the energy requirements,
which is best met by an increase in the carbohydrates
not to exceed this proportion. The following
table gives the average dietetic needs of women:</p>

<p>There is only a fraction of an ounce daily increase
in the weight of the baby. A baby weighing 6½ to 7½
pounds at birth is more natural and easier for the mother
than a heavy, fat baby, which is produced by overeating,
overdrinking, and insufficient exercise.</p>

<p>The toxin-free diet, the quantity at one meal, and
the time of meals are matters for careful consideration.
During this period there is an increased production
of waste, poisonous substances, and gases; at the
same time there is often an increased tendency toward
constipation. Auto-intoxication consequently results,
causing much discomfort from nausea, headaches, dizziness,
melancholia, nervousness, irritability. Special
care should therefore be taken to select a diet (1)chiefly
free from purins, (2)and from stimulants, (3)higher in
base-forming than acid-forming elements, (4)with
high mineral content, especially lime, and (5)laxative.
This is done by omitting, or using very sparingly,
meats, coffee, tea, pastry, fried foods, irritating
condiments, vinegar; and by including milk,
buttermilk made with the Bulgarian tablets, cheese,
eggs, nuts, whole-wheat bread, bran bread, green
vegetables, salads, fresh and dried fruits, fruit juices,
butter, olive oil. Any food that is difficult of digestion,
or that produces fermentation or gas, should be
omitted.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Enough water should be taken to carry off waste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
products but not to unduly increase the body fluids or
cause flabbiness of tissues. With the diet recommended,
less water drinking will be necessary than
otherwise, six glasses a day probably being quite ample.
This should be taken at intervals, not more than a small
glass at one time, and not less than half an hour from
meal times; fruit juices or milk may be taken instead
of plain water.</p>

<p>Alcohol, even in dilute quantities, is highly injurious
to the delicate nerve cells of the body, and should be
avoided, particularly during this and the nursing period.
Patent medicines usually contain alcohol.</p>

<p>With a well regulated diet, there is less probability of
cravings for unusual or abnormal foods; such cravings
may be pampered if for wholesome foods; if absurd or
abnormal, they should be ignored.</p>

<p>During the last four months, and especially the last
two, it is better to take the food in five meals than in
three meals. There is less room in the trunk for the
stomach to expand in the movements of digestion,
and it may easily crowd uncomfortably upon the heart.
The heaviest meal should be taken in the middle of
the day, and a light supper two or three hours before
bedtime, for adequate digestion and comfortable sleep.
During the last month, the daily diet may well include
one or two pints of milk in some form, because of its
ease in digestion.</p>

<p><b>Bathing.</b> A daily bath is especially important during
this period, because there is so much waste and poison
to be eliminated. If the pores of the skin are not kept
clean and open, the kidneys (the work of which is now
much increased) will be overtaxed, or some of the poison
will remain in the system, causing headaches, nausea,
and other discomforts. Very cold or very hot baths
are equally to be avoided. The latter may cause a
miscarriage, especially during the first three months.
A woman who is accustomed to a daily cold bath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
may continue this as long as there is a good reaction.
Surf bathing is inadvisable because of the low temperature
and the muscular strain; bathing in quiet waters
is quite safe. The daily bath should be warm enough
for cleansing (90°-98° F.), followed by a cool sponge
or spray for tonic. A salt bath (one quart of sea or
coarse salt dissolved in a tub of water) is a good tonic.
Two baths daily are permissible, not remaining in the
water more than ten minutes. A vigorous rub with
bath mitts, a Turkish towel, or coarse damp salt, is a
further aid to skin elimination. Vaginal douches
should never be used except on the advice of the
physician. For sleeplessness, nervousness, congestion
of blood in the head, the neutral (96° F.) sitz bath combined
with a hot foot bath will promote the necessary
equalizing of the circulation.</p>

<p><b>Exercise.</b> Exercise now has two important purposes:
the elimination of waste, and the strengthening
of back and abdominal muscles. The precautions
are avoidance of fatigue and of sudden or severe strain
upon the abdominal muscles that might produce a
miscarriage. During the first three months, the placental
attachment is relatively insecure and therefore
more easily detached. The certainty of motherhood
cannot be established until the third or fourth month,
although some presumptive symptoms are manifested
earlier. The woman who has left motherhood to
chance, and who therefore is not preparing for necessary
care during these earlier months, is the more
liable to a miscarriage through disregard of due precautions.</p>

<p>The ideal for this period would be complete outdoor
living, with two miles of walking each day and plenty
of light exercise that could be dropped at the approach
of fatigue. Such a gypsy-like experience is often removed
from usual living conditions. With a little
planning, it could often be approached, however. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
investment in such a vacation would yield <b>far richer</b>
returns to the baby than an expensive layette, to say
nothing of the increased comfort, ease, and happiness
of the mother. The extreme antithesis of this ideal
would be continuous indoor life with no work to
occupy muscles and mind.</p>

<p>The individual mother must plan her environment
and her work as nearly as possible to the ideal.
Living in the country with good roads has the
advantage of outdoors. An outdoor sleeping porch
is much to be desired. For indoor sleeping or working,
the room should be thoroughly ventilated with
a constant current of fresh outdoor air, with the
temperature not above 68° F. for working, and from
32° to 60° F. for sleeping. Extra clothing may be
worn rather than to keep the windows closed.</p>

<p>A habit of deep breathing of outdoor air for about ten
minutes on rising, at bedtime, and at several stated times
during the day, will be wonderfully beneficial. The
mother is now breathing for two, and the baby needs
much oxygen.</p>

<p>Light household work is beneficial. Long standing,
lifting, or pulling heavy weights, scrubbing on
hands and knees, running up and downstairs, much
stooping, working long over a hot stove, the use of a
sewing-machine treadle or a washboard, are harmful.
If the responsibility of the household work rests upon
the mother, she must use her ingenuity to reduce it
to its lowest terms of muscular energy.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Walking is the best athletic exercise, two miles a
day being desirable. It should be taken in easy stages,
stopping to rest when tired, or a part of this distance
taken at different times during the day. Golf, tennis,
basketball, skating, horseback riding, bicycle riding,
swimming, rowing, dancing, surf bathing, long rides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
over rough roads, involve the risk of overstrain, and
should be omitted.</p>

<p><em>Special Exercises.</em> Clothing should always be very
loose, especially around the waist, and the room
should be well ventilated, for these exercises.</p>

<p><em>Breathing Exercises.</em> These should be taken out of
doors if possible; otherwise, at an open window.
Breathing should be from the diaphragm. Repeat each
exercise three to six times, or until fatigue begins.</p>

<p>1. Standing, hands on lowest margin of ribs, thumbs
toward back, fingers few inches apart. Blow the
breath out slowly, bending body forward at hips and
pressing in gently with the hands to force out the air.
Return slowly to upright position, breathing in through
the nose gently to utmost capacity. Hold breath ten
seconds and repeat exercise.</p>

<p>2. Stand erect. Take a deep breath, rising on balls
of feet, extending arms out at side, shoulders high,
hands clenched and describing small circles, as though
boring. Hold ten seconds, then gently drop arms,
blowing out the breath as long as possible.</p>

<p>3. Lying on the back, hold one nostril closed and
breathe in slowly and deeply through the other. Hold
the breath five or ten seconds, close the second nostril,
and breathe out through the first. Repeat, breathing
in through the first and holding the second closed;
hold the breath, close the first, and breathe out through
the second. This is a soothing exercise.</p>

<p><em>Trunk Exercises.</em> Any one not accustomed to these
exercises should consult the physician before beginning
them during this period. All exercises should be
done slowly, with no jerking movements.</p>

<p>For overcoming constipation, improving the tone,
elasticity, and strength of the abdominal muscles.</p>

<p>1. Lie flat on the back, arms at the sides. Raise the
right arm slowly, keeping it parallel with the body,
describing a half circle until it rests on the bed or floor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
above the head. Repeat with the left arm. Bring
each arm slowly back to position. (Figure 2.)</p>

<p>2. Same position. Raise the right foot, keeping the
toes pointed forward, bending the knee until it touches
the abdomen. Repeat with the left foot. May be
repeated ten times or until fatigued. (Figure 1.)</p>

<p>3. Same position. Bend knees; draw the abdominal
wall in and out slowly by muscular effort, without the
assistance of deep breathing.</p>

<p>4. Same position. Lift the trunk from the floor,
resting the weight on shoulders and hips.</p>

<p>5. Sit or stand, hands on hips. Twist the body
slowly to the right and slowly return to position. Repeat,
twisting to the left.</p>

<p>6. Walk up and down stairs moderately with a
springing step, holding the body erect, shoulders
straight, chest expanded, mouth closed, weight on
balls of feet.</p>

<p>These simplest and easiest exercises may be continued
throughout this period or may be commenced at any
time.</p>

<p>The following exercises are more strenuous and
should be used cautiously during the first three and
last two months by those not accustomed to exercise.
The physician should be consulted before using them
during this time. They are profitably begun six months
beforehand and are valuable for ordinary conditions of
life.</p>

<p>7. Lie on the back, arms at sides. Raise both arms
together, as in Exercise 1. Bring arms back slowly to
sides.</p>

<p>8. Same position. Raise the right foot, toes pointed
forward, knee straight till leg is at right angles with
trunk; hold position ten seconds and lower foot slowly.
Repeat with left foot. Raise both feet together.
(Figure 2.)</p>

<p>9. Lying flat on back, hands on chest or clasped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
behind head, feet held down under a chiffonier or by an
attendant, come to sitting position without assistance
of hands or elbows. (Figure 4.)</p>

<p>10. Lie on the back, grasp the rounds of the headboard
and gently pull the body toward the head of the
bed. Push with the feet against the footboard, or
other non-resisting surface.</p>

<p>The knee-chest position is a most valuable exercise.
It relieves the abdominal pressure, and therefore any
swelling in the legs from such pressure, or any prolapsis
of internal organs, bearing-down feelings, backache,
disturbed pelvic circulation. It may be taken a few
minutes at a time, several times a day. Sleeplessness
will often be relieved by taking this position for a few
minutes and then lying down. Kneel on the floor or
other unyielding surface. Lay the side of the face
down on this surface, with the shoulder of that side as
near the knees as possible, keeping the upper leg
from knee to hip at right angles with the floor. Weight
may be supported on forearms placed at right angles
to the body.</p>

<p>A good posture should always be maintained when
sitting or standing; especially avoid letting the chest
sink in. Whenever possible in sitting, especially after
meals, elevate the feet, thus preventing varicose veins
and swelling in the legs.</p>

<p><b>Sleep.</b> Much sleep is needed. From eight to ten
hours’ sleep at night is essential, and a nap or rest in the
afternoon, about an hour after the midday meal. By
following the régime previously given, undisturbed
sleep is likely to be the rule. The mother should sleep
alone, and preferably in a room by herself. A little
pillow under the small of the back is very comfortable,
and during the last four months, an additional pillow
under the shoulders.</p>

<p><b>Teeth, Hair, Eyes.</b> The teeth should have been
examined and put in good condition before the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of this period. During the entire time they should
be brushed carefully after every meal, and the mouth
rinsed with an alkaline wash, such as milk of magnesia
or soda bicarbonate. The scalp should be massaged
every day during the last two months and the two succeeding
months, to prevent the hair falling out. The
eyes should be examined three months after the birth.</p>

<p><b>Prenatal Influences.</b> Life begins when the germ
cells unite, and from that time the mother is the guardian
of a living, though immature child. By the end of the
third month the form and features are complete, though
in miniature, the weight is about four ounces and the
length about three inches. The study of development
before birth is called embryology. So far as scientific
research has been able to discover, there are no nerve
cells connecting the nervous system of the mother with
that of the child. Notwithstanding superstitions and
folklore to the contrary, it is scientifically known that
she cannot give her child a Greek nose by looking at
classic pictures, an ape face through seeing some disagreeable
sight, or musical genius by attending concerts.
Anatomical form and mental traits are matters
of heredity, as previously stated, and these factors are
settled forever when the germ cells unite. The sex
is also determined at that time, apparently depending
upon the sex-determining factors in the germ cells.
Hundreds of theories (such as the diet or the condition
of the parents) have been suggested for influencing
the sex of the child, but none of these is
as yet proven true, and certainly no such influence
can have any effect after the germ cells have united.
“Birthmarks,” such as red or blue spots, are probably
due to some interference with the blood supply during
development.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Approved Crib, Scales, Nursery Table. Holding the Baby, Supporting Head and Back.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The mother is influencing the child during the entire
nine months, through the blood supply. If she indulges
in fear, anger, melancholy (dark emotions that develop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>poison in the blood), if she over-eats, or takes alcohol,
if she neglects deep breathing, daily bathing, elimination,
exercise, she is impoverishing and poisoning the
blood supply, and the quality of her child’s bodily and
mental characteristics will suffer. If she lives a wholesome
life, following a régime that continuously eliminates
poisons and gives abundant nourishment and
oxygen, with the cultivation of peace, cheer, courage,
joy (emotions that promote good circulation and a
wholesome blood stream), she is providing good
nourishment and enhancing the quality of her child’s
life.</p>

<p>It is for the comfort of the mother and for the welfare
and beauty of the child that the mother should be
sacredly reserved for her work during this and the
nursing period.</p>

<p>A normal woman whose physical life through her
childhood and adolescence has been well regulated
should have an easy experience. A certain amount of
discomfort and mental depression is to be accepted as
a matter of course, but the greater care now given to
physical hygiene would naturally increase health and
vitality. Concerts, plays, lectures, and social gatherings
(except where these would involve crowds and
ill-ventilated, overheated rooms), reading, music, play,
should all be part of her life during this time. The joy
of anticipation gives the singing heart and makes this
a time of beatitude, of weaving of dreams such as no
other experience in life can give.</p>

<p>The preparation of the nursery and the baby clothes
is part of the joyous experience. This may well begin
early, that it may proceed leisurely, without sense of
haste, and with its full measure of satisfaction. Simplicity,
cleanliness, economy in care, daintiness, are
the keynotes.</p>

<p><b>The Nursery.</b> Room. It is desirable that the baby
should have a room alone. If this is not possible, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
room should be equipped for the nursery, and only the
mother or nurse should sleep in the same room. Sunny
exposure is essential. Second floor is preferable, for
dryness, and freedom from cats and dogs. A covered,
sunny veranda for outdoor sleeping is most desirable.
The room should be ventilated from two sides, and
preferably with open fireplace.</p>

<p>Floor. Washable, either painted, oiled or waxed,
<em>never carpeted</em>. Small size washable rugs.</p>

<p>Walls. Washable, either painted or covered with
Sanitas, at least to wainscot four feet high. Soft,
plain, neutral tone; buff, warm gray or medium green.</p>

<p>Curtains. Both light and dark shades; sheer,
washable curtains, plain or figured scrim; no heavy
window draperies or portières.</p>

<p>Heating. Preferably hot-water heater, with open
fireplace for occasions. Steam and hot-air systems
lack a sufficient amount of moisture, and are subject
to sudden changes in temperature. Gas or kerosene
stoves consume the oxygen and should not be used in
the nursery. Coal stoves should be carefully watched
to avoid poisonous gases from imperfect combustion,
or sudden changes in temperature. Large open basins
of fresh water should be kept in the room in winter,
to supply humidity.</p>

<p>Lighting. A dim, shaded light for night use, lit
only when needed. Nursery should be dark at night;
daylight soft but not darkened, during first two weeks;
ordinary lighting thereafter during waking hours,
softened but not dark during daytime sleep.</p>

<p>Baby Carriage. High; not less than 14 inches wide,
and 28 inches long, inside measurements; wood body
preferable to reed or rattan (latter should be kept free
from dust by frequent cleaning); detachable, washable
covering to upholstery; good springs, brake, rubber
tires; porous hood with lining dark green, brown, or
gray to protect eyes (never white), ventilated by holes
near top or by side curtains; ample drop for feet when
baby is sitting up; reversible body or handles desirable.</p>

<p>Baby Pen. The nursery table or crib will answer
until the sitting stage, at five or six months, and the
crib until the creeping or climbing stage, at seven or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
nine months. A pen four to six feet square gives room
for tumbling and creeping. It should have a wood bottom,
preferably of slats loosely joined (for flexibility).
Raised six inches above the floor, to escape drafts;
sides made of slats or plain round rods 4 inches apart,
2½ feet high; edges rounded; clean detached quilt
or table felting over floor. Sides may be hinged to fold
away. A large packing box, sides padded, raised on
6-inch blocks, may be used for economy. The light-weight
pens, resting on the floor, usually found in the
shops, are drafty and inadvisable.</p>


<p><b>Harmful Equipment.</b> The following have no place
in a baby welfare nursery:</p>

<p>All unsanitary germ holders, such as sponge, powder
puff, basket trimmings, open or porous toilet basket,
pacifier, veil.</p>

<p>Rubber or other waterproof diapers, because they
are unavoidably heating and irritating; feathers, because
too heating; linen sheets, which are cold and
chilling.</p>

<p>Pinning bands or swaddling clothes, which prevent
the activity so essential for growth.</p>

<p>Cradles or rocking bassinets, which are injurious to
the nerves.</p>

<p>Baby-walkers, because they keep the baby too long
on his feet and legs when he needs the intermittent rest
of lying down while learning to walk; they retard his
confidence in walking alone, and are a cause of dangerous
falls.</p>

<p>Low go-carts and sulkies, which keep the baby in the
low strata of dust and germ-laden air, and which are
frequently badly proportioned for good posture.</p>

<p>Soothing syrups, patent medicines, paregoric, whiskey,
brandy; they are all poisonous.</p>

<p>Patent artificial foods; they are expensive and an
inefficient makeshift.</p>

<p>Knitted binders are more elastic than flannel.</p>

<p>Cotton bird’s-eye, or cheap outing flannel diapering
is warmer and more absorbent than linen or canton
flannel; stockinet is best.</p>

<p>Cotton material for slips, and lace or embroidery for
trimmings, should be <em>very soft</em>.</p>

<p>Viyella flannel, which is half wool and non-shrinking,
is most satisfactory; loosely woven flannel, half
wool, with silk or cotton, is soft, shrinks little, and is
warmer than heavy, close weaves.</p>

<p>Outing or Shaker flannel is all cotton; the soft nap
is highly inflammable.</p>

<p>Crêpe, crepon, and woolens, should be shrunk before
making.</p>

<p>Knitted shawls, jackets, and quilts are warmer and
lighter than woven fabrics; avoid colors unless guaranteed
non-fading.</p>

<p>For the knitted (ready-made) shirts, some authorities
prefer all cotton, others part wool. All wool is never
advisable, as the baby’s skin is very sensitive, and
furthermore, all wool shrinks badly. For most babies,
under average conditions, one-quarter wool, three-quarters
cotton or silk is advised. In very warm
weather, all cotton is better. In very cold climates,
half or three-quarters wool may be advisable. Silk
has no special advantage over cotton. Babies with
very delicate skin, eczema, or any rash should never
have wool next the skin. Some manufacturers now
make part wool knitted underwear, having only the
cotton thread next the skin, wool outside.</p>

<p>The binder is worn only two or three weeks, as a
protector to the navel until it is healed. It should be
fastened comfortably, <em>not tight</em>. With delicate babies
or those out of doors in cold weather, a band with
shoulder straps may be worn as a substitute during the
first year, although this is unnecessary with a double-breasted
shirt. The Vanta binders and shirts (double-breasted),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>fastening with twistless tape instead of
buttons, are especially satisfactory.</p>

<p><em>Making.</em> Preparation of the baby clothes should be
a joy and not a worry or burden. Let them be simple,
moderate in quantity.</p>

<p>The kimono or raglan sleeve gowns, wrappers, and
coats are much easier to put on and off than the set-in
sleeve. By liberal measure under the shoulders, the
sleeve will not pull out; a gathering string at the cuff
for little babies will keep the hand from slipping out.</p>

<p>All seams should be flat.</p>

<p>Seams on woolen garments should be felled or edges
featherstitched flat. Armhole and neck of flannel
garments should be covered with soft seam-binding
or turned back ¼ inch and raw edge stitched down or
featherstitched; never turn under, as this makes a
ridge. At hem of flannel petticoat, raw edge need not
be turned in but may be featherstitched flat.</p>

<p>Sleeves may be turned back in a 2-inch hem for first
months.</p>

<p>Edge of dress sleeves and neck may be finished with a
⅛-inch hem with featherstitching, or a narrow Armenian
or val lace, or soft batiste embroidery, whipped
on; or twistless tape or wash ribbon ¼ to ½ inch wide,
may be run through facing or beading at neck and one
or two inches from edge of sleeve.</p>

<p>Fine gathers or tucks may be made in the front and
back of slips to form a yoke; these may be taken out
later as the baby grows.</p>

<p>Beading, or buttonholed eyelets two inches apart,
for wash ribbon sash, may be made in dresses, thus
forming a yoke; leave garment loose two inches each
side of under-arm seam.</p>

<p>Maximum length allowable for dresses and petticoats,
27 inches; minimum, 22 inches; hems, 1 to 3 inches.</p>

<p>Neckbands, 9½ inches at birth to 10 inches at 6
months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Sleeve bands should be 8 to 12 inches long.</p>

<p>Average length of infant, neck to soles, at birth, is
16 inches; at 6 months, 24 inches.</p>

<p>Set-in sleeves, small cuffs, small neckband, tiny
buttons, make dressing difficult. Gathering string of
twistless tape or ribbon, with beading, at sleeves and
neck, are recommended, or ample neckbands.</p>

<p>Kohinoor snappers are preferable to buttons, using
care in laundering to prevent bending. If sewed on to
linen tape, which can be used as a facing for material,
there is less strain on goods.</p>

<p><b>Short Clothes.</b> Clothes are usually shortened at
four months in summer or six months in winter, keeping
about the same models.</p>

<p>Rompers are convenient after creeping begins. The
English use diaper drawers knitted of soft wool.</p>

<p>Leather moccasins, made after the Indian model,
with <em>seams outside</em>, are the best footgear until the
walking stage, at twelve to fifteen months.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Everything in after life depends upon uninterrupted healthy
growth during infancy.”</p>

<p class="right">
—<span class="smcap">Doctor F. Truby King.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“There is no young creature in the world so ignorantly and
cruelly nurtured as the average infant.”</p>

<p class="right">

</p>

<p>“Since what is needed most is intelligent care, all proper
means should be employed to educate mothers and those caring
for infants, in proper methods of doing this.”</p>

<p class="right">
—<span class="smcap">Doctor L. Emmett Holt.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The baby is a unity of body, mind, and soul, and these
cannot be separated in his actual life. During every
minute of his care, in every detail, his whole nature is
being influenced and his character shaped. It is only
for convenience of discussion that the physical régime
is separated from the rest of his care.</p>

<p>The régime here outlined is for normal, well babies,
for their first year or two. Delicate, feeble, or sickly
infants must receive special care, under the physician’s
directions, in their feeding, bathing, clothing, and outdoor
living.</p>

<p>There are only a few fundamental principles, but
these are to be practiced with conscientious thoroughness
by every one who has anything to do with
the child. It is the little details in the routine of
his daily life that produce vigor or weakness. Errors
in his care now easily cost his life; or apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
they may not harm him now but will be paid for in
suffering, deformities, or weakness in childhood or adulthood.
The woman who has this responsibility needs
special preparation in self-sacrifice, self-control, gentleness,
regularity, thoroughness, and accuracy in little
details. She should be in good health, free from any
contagious disease.</p>

<p><b>Fundamental Principles.</b></p>

<p>1. Regularity, particularly in feeding, sleep, stools</p>

<p>2. Cleanliness of baby, food, clothing, utensils,
toys, nursery</p>

<p>3. Fresh air and sunshine, Nature’s great disinfectants
and vitalizers</p>

<p>4. Gradual, moderate changes in temperatures,
clothing, food, régime</p>

<p>5. Quiet, because the brain and nervous system are
yet incomplete in their development, and are very
sensitive; the maximum of sleep, with little stimulation
while awake. The brain grows as much during
the first year as during all the rest of life.</p>

<p>6. Gentleness in handling, to prevent any curvature
or misshaping of the soft bones, or shocks to the nerves</p>

<p>7. Moderate warmth, which avoids either chilling
or coddling</p>

<p>8. Freedom of movement, for only thus can body
and mind normally develop</p>

<p>9. Training in self-control, which can begin the first
day and needs daily attention</p>

<p>10. Mothering, cuddling, fondling, regularly every
day, <em>before</em> feeding, at bath or dressing times, an hour
previous to bedtime</p>

<p>11. Holding and Lifting. The whole length of the
spine and the weight of the head must be well supported
until the baby is strong enough, at six or seven months
of age, to support these himself. In lifting a young
baby, the left hand and arm are slipped under the
head, neck, and upper back, the right hand under the
lower back. He may be carried in one arm by supporting
the head in the crook of the elbow and supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the entire length of the back with the forearm,
wrist, and hand. If held in an upright position
at this early age, the wobbly head should always
be supported. <em>Never</em> lift a baby or little child
by his arms.</p>

<p><b>Daily Régime.</b> The following schedule is in general
typical for the first year. It will vary somewhat with
the age of the baby, the climate and season. In varying
from this schedule, note that the following factors
are important and to be observed strictly:</p>

<p>1. Regularity in feeding</p>

<p>2. Interval of one hour after a feeding before bath</p>

<p>3. Interval of one hour between feeding and fruit
juice</p>

<p>4. Interval of twenty to thirty minutes between
feeding or water and urinating; this interval should be
observed for the individual child, that the habit of
control (and the saving of wet diapers) may be established
as early as possible</p>

<p>5. Regular time for stools; by beginning the week
after birth this can be early established, and much unnecessary
work saved</p>

<p>6. Regular time for the bath, scheduled for mid-morning
or for evening, according to which time is
found to agree best with the baby</p>

<p>7. Regular times for play, kicking, cuddling</p>

<p>8. Regular time for weighing, that conditions may
be the same</p>

<p>9. Note that in cool weather the baby should not be
put outdoors until one hour after the bath; and that
an oil rub may be given instead of the cool sponge at
night</p>
<br>

<p>A daily schedule card is of assistance in maintaining
regularity, noting new developments or unusual conditions.
It is advisable to record it at least once a week,
on the day for the weekly weighing.</p>

<p><b>Clothing.</b> The designs previously suggested for the
baby clothes (page 83) are adapted to ease in dressing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
laundering, making, and to freedom of movement.
With these, the baby need be turned only once in
dressing, or not at all, if the dress is fastened in front.
Use only flat, protected safety pins, no common,
straight, or ridged pins. With tapes and snappers,
pins may be eliminated.</p>

<p>It is much easier and more comfortable to dress and
change a baby on the nursery table than on a low bed
or the lap.</p>

<p>The clothes should be put on and off over the feet,
not over the head.</p>

<p>The clothing should be changed completely at the
morning bath and at night. The day outfit is the same
as the night during the first three months. Later the
day slip is worn, as the baby is awake longer. The
nightgown may be of Viyella flannel, the petticoat
then being unnecessary, except with the temperature
below 40°-50° F.</p>

<p>Overdressing, like overfeeding, is a common and
serious mistake. If the baby’s skin is moist to the
touch, he is overwarmly dressed and thereby made
highly susceptible to “colds” and pneumonia. If his
feet are cold, skin “goose-fleshed”, and lips blue, he
needs more clothing. With a room temperature of
68°-70° F., duly humidified, a baby four months or
over usually needs only a diaper, cotton or quarter-wool
double-breasted shirt, flannel petticoat and cotton
slip. The binder is needed only until the navel heals,—about
three weeks. It should be loosely applied,
fastened by tapes rather than by pins or sewing. If
applied tightly or worn longer it hinders the development
of the trunk muscles, interferes with digestion and
breathing, and, contrary to superstition, will not prevent
but may cause rupture. For babies under four months
or with a room temperature below 68° F. a wrapper,
sweater, or sack should be added. The cotton petticoat
is only for ornamental purposes with fine slips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>On warm summer days (over 72° F.) he may dispense
with the petticoat. In very hot weather, also,
substitute a cotton, half-sleeve vest for the long-sleeved
shirt, or after three months dispense with all but the
diaper while awake, adding a cotton slip during naps,
and a cotton shirt at night.</p>

<p>For outdoors, he should not be bundled until the
minute before he departs. A thin cap of cotton, linen,
or silk may be worn in warm weather (or none at all
after three months) and a double one for winter,
not thick enough to cause perspiration. For the first
twelve months a kimono-sleeved coat, with drawstrings
at shoulder and wrist, will provide protection, with the
blankets, for cold weather. The nightgown pattern
may be used to make a sleeping bag of eiderdown, broadcloth,
or flannel. This allows much more freedom than
the usual type of sleeping bag, and is better ventilated.
The hood should be of lighter fabric, knitted or of
flannel, broadcloth, cashmere; eiderdown or angora is
overheating.</p>

<p>Stockings and booties ordinarily are not needed
during the first year except when the baby is kicking
and creeping about with a temperature below 68° F.,
or for appearance when he is taken out in arms.
See that the feet are warm, but not hot or moist.
Stockings are always coming off or getting wet from
the diaper; they keep the feet perspiring, making them
tender and increasing the possibility of colds. When
worn, they should be of cotton, or in very cold weather,
one quarter or one half wool; all wool are overheating
and shrink badly. When the baby begins standing or
creeping, the leather Indian moccasins may be used.
Other baby shoes on the market have many faults,—tightness
across toes and instep, seams turned inside,
non-porous patent leather; slippery, stiff, or rough
soles; they produce only discomfort at the time and
are productive of callouses, corns, bunions, and misshaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
feet. At twelve or fifteen months a heavier-soled
Indian moccasin may be worn or sandals with
flexible, corrugated soles, roomy at the toes, shaped
like the foot, right and left, soft, porous (not patent)
leather, perfectly smooth inside, using gaiters or leggings
with these for out-of-doors in damp or cold
weather.</p>

<p><b>Diapering.</b> Reduce the number of wet and soiled
diapers by training.</p>

<p>Begin training at one week of age.</p>

<p>Hold a small (warmed) cuspidor firmly in the lap.</p>

<p>Hold the baby above this, the legs extended in the
hands, back resting against the mother’s chest.</p>

<p>Do this at regular time for stool, early morning or
late afternoon.</p>

<p>The use of a suppository for a few days will assist; use
a little roll of soft, clean paper dipped in liquid vaseline.</p>

<p>Note on daily record the interval between feeding or
drinking, and urinating (20 to 30 minutes).</p>

<p>Hold the baby for urinating at these regular times
when awake and before beginning the bath.</p>

<p>In a few months he will learn to control the bladder
as well as the bowels for these times, when awake.</p>

<p>At eight or ten months the baby may be supported
on the toilet seat, by using the baby’s detachable toilet
chair now manufactured. A nursery chair for this
purpose is not advised. They are usually wrongly
proportioned and constructed; and the child is usually
left alone to sit for half an hour or more, thereby inducing
local irritation, deferred action, prolapsis of
the rectum through straining, or bad habits. The
mother or nurse should always stay with the child,
and the least possible time should be permitted.</p>

<p>Change the diaper as soon as the baby wakes or
immediately, if it becomes wet while he is awake.
(The urine is salty, sometimes acid, and always irritating.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Before removing diaper, have at hand everything
needed, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Clean, dry, warm, folded diaper<br>

Diaper preferably folded oblong and fastened at
the sides<br>

Diaper handbasin with warm water<br>

Special wash cloth and towel kept only for diapering<br>

Powder, zinc ointment<br>

Diaper bucket</p>
</div>

<p>Lay the baby on the nursery table, on a Turkish towel.</p>

<p>If pins are used, put into blanket at right hand,
removed from baby’s reach.</p>

<p>Remove the diaper and drop it into bucket.</p>

<p>Wash baby clean and pat dry, especially in creases.</p>

<p>Use powder very sparingly or not at all.</p>

<p>Use albolene or zinc ointment for chafed places.</p>

<p>Put on dry diaper.</p>

<p>Leave baby in safe position while putting away
utensils.</p>

<p>Never use a diaper a second time without washing;
the acid and salty urine deposit will cause chafing.</p>

<p>Avoid pulling tight about the waist; the pelvic
bones are now only cartilage, easily misshaped; if
pelvis is narrowed in girls, childbirth will be made
more difficult for them.</p>

<p>Avoid tightness in front, especially for boys, as this
will produce irritation.</p>

<p>Avoid much thickness between the legs; it will
cause bow legs.</p>

<p>Never use rubber or other waterproof diapers; they
are overheating and may cause bad habits.</p>

<p>A small pad of cotton batting folded into sterilized
cheesecloth, or a double fold of Turkish toweling or
stockinet placed in the diaper will absorb moisture
and avoid the extra thickness of a heavy diaper; this
pad may be burned if soiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>A quilted or stockinet pad placed between the diaper
and petticoat will prevent drenching of clothes while
asleep.</p>

<p>If diaper is fastened to shirt, make sure of ample
length; avoid any pull on shirt or diaper.</p>

<p>Throw water from basin into toilet or slop bucket, not
into lavatory.</p>

<p>Wash out cloth, disposing of water in same way;
or put cloth into diaper bucket.</p>

<p>If diaper is soiled, flush off in toilet before putting
to soak.</p>

<p><em>Wash hands</em> thoroughly in the special basin, with
soap and water, after changing diaper.</p>

<p>If marked congestion of genitals, or a discharge
appears, take special care to disinfect hands and
burn cloths and diapers. Report the condition at
once to the physician; these symptoms may indicate a
serious disease.</p>

<p>Never let a child use a public toilet without placing
paper or cloth over the seat; children’s detachable
seats may be purchased that can be carried in traveling.</p>

<p><b>Laundering.</b> Baby clothes should be washed with a
mild white soap, such as Ivory, and thoroughly rinsed.
Diapers require special care. They should be thoroughly
boiled and rinsed. Laundry soap, soda, or
bluing should not be used, but Ivory soap, with borax
or ammonia if necessary. Dry in sun if possible.
Ironing is not necessary.</p>

<p>Boiling, outdoor sunshine, and pressing with a hot
iron, are all sterilizing processes.</p>

<p>Starch is never to be used in baby clothes, which
should always be soft and non-irritating.</p>

<p>For woolens, use warm water; add soap in solution,
not rubbing on clothes; add one teaspoonful of borax
or ammonia per gallon of water, if very soiled.
Squeeze, or wash with vacuum washer; do not rub,
but use hand brush on very soiled places. Squeeze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
or press without twisting. Rinse through two waters,
same temperature as the first. A teaspoonful of glycerine
per gallon of water, added to the last rinsing
water, preserves softness.</p>

<p>Dry at once by moderate heat; avoid freezing or
extreme heat. Stretch into shape, and lay on frames
or towels to dry, turning once or twice. If pressing is
desired, use a moderately hot iron. Cheesecloth between
iron and fabric preserves softness.</p>


<p><b>Bathing.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">One bath every day<br>

Sponge bath until cord heals; later, tub bath<br>

Not within an hour after feeding<br>

Not when greatly fatigued<br>

Tub bath preferably in morning, before second feeding;
otherwise, before third or evening feeding</p>
</div>

<p>In warm weather an additional sponge bath at night
(same as lower temperature of morning) is advisable.</p>

<p>In hot weather give two or three sponge baths 70°
to 90° F., according to age, in addition.</p>

<p>In cold weather, an oil rub at night may be given
instead of sponge<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> bath.</p>

<p><em>Temperature for bath</em> is always to be regulated by
bath thermometer. Changes to be gradual, by 1° F.,
from day to day.</p>

<p>Until sixth or eighth month, tub bath 98° to 100°
F., followed by cool. Then reduce 1° a fortnight, to
90° F.</p>

<p>After second week, a dash of cool water (90° F.)
applied by hand to back (begin at lower end), chest and
buttocks. At two months lower by 2° F. and apply
with wash cloth; lower 2° F. each month to 80° F.,
so long as baby reacts well—skin rosy and warm, not
blue lips, goose flesh, cold feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Cool water may be added slowly while baby is in
tub, but not hot water.</p>

<p><em>Giving the Bath.</em> Before beginning to undress the
baby, have everything ready, and just before undressing
the baby, wash the hands thoroughly.</p>

<p>Costume: wash dress, sleeves to elbow, bib apron,
bath apron.</p>

<p>Room: no drafts; temperature about 70° F. (65°-72°).</p>

<p>Equipment: Clean tub or basin filled with bath
water; enamel, tin, or rubber tub may be used; after
six months, large tub may be used. Heavy bath towel
may be placed in bottom of tub.</p>

<p>Prepare tray with toilet articles and rolled gauze.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Bath thermometer; supply of hot and cold water.</p>

<p>Fresh wash cloths for face and body, kept only for
baby.</p>

<p>Soft face towel; two large bath towels spread on
nursery table.</p>

<p>Laid out in order for dressing; dry, warm clothes,
petticoat placed inside of dress; wrapper or shawl.</p>

<p>Allow fifteen to twenty minutes for undressing, exercises,
bathing, dressing.</p>

<p>Allow five to ten minutes for rubbing and exercise.</p>

for the tub. Ears, eyes, and head are washed before
going in the tub; also the buttocks, if soiled, using
the diaper basin and cloth, not the bath water.</p>

<p><em>Ears.</em> Use sterilized cheesecloth or old soft muslin
squares, little or no soap.</p>

<p>Use warm water from tub.</p>

<p>Wash carefully in all creases and behind the ears; let

<p>Never use a comb or harsh rubbing.</p>

<p><em>Body Bath.</em> Note temperature of water and modify
with supply at hand to exact degree. Place the baby
in the tub, supporting the head and upper back with left
hand. Baby may be lowered in the towel, if afraid.</p>

<p>Remove wet towel.</p>

<p>In warm weather, after two months, allow an air
bath one to three minutes, patting or gently rubbing
skin with the hand.</p>

<p>Avoid the use of powder, except in hot weather, in
creases, for fat babies; powder clogs the pores.</p>

<p>Put zinc ointment or albolene on chafed places.</p>

<p>If there is any bulging of the umbilicus, put two
strips of surgeon’s plaster across, to hold in place and
prevent rupture.</p>

<p>During first four to six weeks, gently draw back

<p><b>Care of Nursery.</b> Watch the temperature, humidity,
and ventilation; keep the room well sunned.</p>

<p>Air the room and bedding thoroughly with a strong
air current from ten to thirty minutes twice a day,
while baby is out of the room.</p>

<p>Keep clothing, towels, bedding, and furniture orderly
and clean.</p>

<p>Drying of clothing and bedding, or cooking, should
not be done here.</p>

<p>When baby is creeping or walking, take special
care that pins, needles, scissors, matches, and other
small objects are not on floor or in reach.</p>

<p>Clean daily while baby is out of room; dust is the
baby’s worst enemy.</p>

<p>Dust-raisers, such as corn or whisk brooms, feather
or dry cloth dusters, are not to be used.</p>

<p>Carved woodwork or furniture, bric-a-brac or other
dust catchers are out of place in the nursery.</p>

<p>Use a vacuum cleaner, dustless mop, oiled or damp
dusting cloths; for toys, use a clean damp cloth.</p>

<p>Wipe floor, window-sills, furniture and toys, and
vacuum-clean rugs.</p>

<p><b>Weekly Cleaning.</b> Vacuum-clean rugs, floor, moldings,
ledges, and walls.</p>

<p>Hang rugs out of doors from one to three hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Wash or wax floor; wash window-sills, doors, picture
frames.</p>

<p>Hang fresh window curtains, screen curtains, crib
draperies.</p>

<p>Wash bassinet canopy; brush bassinet thoroughly
outdoors.</p>

<p>Clean carriage frame with vacuum, brush, and damp
cloth.</p>

<p><b>Feeding.</b> The kinds of food, quantity, intervals, and
times of feeding are important.</p>

<p>The only natural and adequate food is mother’s milk.
No thoroughly satisfying substitute has ever been
found, or is likely to be. Mother’s milk has the following
advantages:</p>

<p>1. It is germicidal—it contains no harmful bacteria,
and it has elements which destroy disease germs
in the baby. The babies that are nursed have a special
protection against such diseases as influenza, whooping-cough,
measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria.</p>

<p>2. It is always clean, and therefore greatly reduces
the possibility of diarrhea. Only one breast-fed baby
dies to ten bottle-fed babies.</p>

<p>3. It does not sour.</p>

<p>4. It requires no time for preparation or care of
bottles.</p>

<p>5. It is always ready.</p>

<p>6. It is balanced in proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
for the baby’s needs, and the proportion of these
elements changes with his development.</p>

<p>7. It is in fine, soft curds, adapted to the baby’s
stomach and digestion.</p>

<p>8. It contains vitamines, the living, organic principles
essential to growth, and found only in fresh or
slightly cooked foods.</p>

<p>9. It has growth-producing properties found in no
substitute. In a study made not long since of 100,000
French soldiers, it was found that the group of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
who in their infancy had been nursed for six months
averaged heavier and taller than those nursed only
three months; the group nursed nine months likewise
exceeded in height and stature those nursed only six
months. Similar phenomena have been noted by
many observers.</p>

<p>10. It produces better teeth, less subject to decay,
both first and second set.</p>

<p>11. Nursing her baby promotes the return of
pelvic organs to their normal condition, and thus
promotes the mother’s comfort, shapeliness and health.</p>

<p>12. It fosters her love for her baby, and the baby’s
love for her.</p>

<p>Patent baby foods are usually either some form of
dried or condensed milk, or a dextrinized cereal. The
constituents having been subjected to a high temperature,
the vitamines have been destroyed; there are
frequent cases of scurvy among babies so fed. These
preparations usually contain a high percentage of
starch or sugar, with an insufficiency of proteins, fats,
and minerals; this produces plump babies that look
flourishing in pictures, but that are lacking in solid
muscles, bone and nerve tissue, and are subject to
rickets, With little resistance for pneumonia or other
germ diseases. Patent baby foods, condensed or powdered
milk, are the last makeshift.</p>

<p>If artificial feeding becomes necessary, clean cow’s
milk is the best substitute. Cow’s milk is made for
the calf, whose stomach and digestion are much coarser,
and development much more rapid, than the baby’s.
As produced, it contains too high a percentage of protein
and lime, too low a percentage of sugar and phosphorus,
and the curd is too large and coarse for the
baby’s digestion. It is difficult to produce perfectly
clean, and to keep perfectly sweet until feeding. It
must be modified carefully, according to the age and
condition of the baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>The formula is a technical matter for the medical or
dietetic specialist to work out and prescribe in each
individual case, and to change as the individual baby
requires; it is no more a subject for experiment by a
novice than is a case of fever. The formula prescribed
must be prepared with scrupulous cleanliness and exactness.</p>

<p>As about ninety mothers in every hundred are
fitted and able, with wise prenatal and postnatal hygiene,
to nurse their babies, the subject of artificial
feeding merits relatively less attention.</p>

<p>Ability to nurse is affected by conditions long before
motherhood begins. An active, out-of-door life, with
freedom from nervous strain or worry, and with clothing
that does not compress or overheat the breasts, is important
from childhood. Alcoholism in the mother’s
father, or Cæsarean birth of the child, usually inhibit
nursing.</p>

<p>The ability is increased by a moderate, nutritious
diet,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> including cereals, milk, water (not exceeding an
additional quart of liquid daily beyond the mother’s
normal need); by quiet mind, outdoor living, moderate
exercise; by regularity in nursing, and the complete
emptying of a breast at a nursing. It is decreased
by a contrary régime, by fatigue, nervousness, or by
interrupting or discontinuing the effort to nurse.</p>

<p>Fats are increased by more nutritious diet; proteins,
by diet and decreasing the intervals between nursings.
Fat in the diet does not affect the proportion in the
milk. Indoor life, with overfeeding and insufficient
exercise, will unduly increase the proportion of protein
and cause colic. A too hearty diet, especially if high
in sugars and starches, will unduly increase the fat.
Irregular nursing, nervousness, not completely emptying
the breast, decreasing the liquids in the diet, will
decrease the supply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Every drop of the mother’s milk is of great value to
the baby. If the quantity or quality is not sufficient,
nursings should not be stopped, but one or more supplemented
with modified milk, prescribed by the physician
or dietitian, to furnish the balance. Contagious
disease, except tuberculosis, is not necessarily a contraindication
to nursing. Unless the milk disagrees
with the baby, nursing need not be suspended during
menstruation; otherwise, modified milk may be used
temporarily, and the milk regularly withdrawn. Weaning
should be done slowly, substituting one feeding for
a nursing, and discontinuing other nursings at intervals
of two or three days. In this way the baby is gradually
accustomed to other food, and the mother’s milk
gradually disappears. Reducing the diet and omitting
liquids for a few days will stop the flow of milk.</p>

<p>While the mother is in bed no more food is needed
than under ordinary circumstances, as the food requirement
is low during rest and the quantity needed by the
baby is very small (page 118). An excess of food is
likely to produce indigestion and constipation, and
actually interfere with nursing. Foods easily digested,
laxative, rich in minerals (especially lime and iron)
should be selected through the nursing period. The
diet list as for children six to eight years of age is a
desirable one to follow.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> No patent nostrums should
ever be experimented with; they are worthless when
not harmful. Beer and all forms of alcohol are particularly
to be avoided; they do not increase the
amount of fluid more than would an equal quantity of
water or milk; any increase they produce is of fluid,
not of nutriment; the alcohol enters the baby’s system
unchanged, and may injure his sensitive nerve cells.
Doctor D. D. Bezzola, of Switzerland, who has made
extensive studies of the effects of alcohol upon infancy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
concludes: “The time may come when we shall see
that every drop of alcohol taken by the parent means a
drop of stupidity for the child.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Malt liquors are
apt to disturb the mother’s digestion and cause her to
put on superfluous fat.</p>

<p>Constipation in the mother will produce constipation
in the baby, and laxatives or drugs taken by the
mother are likely to affect the baby. Anger, worry,
excitement produce poisons that render the milk indigestible,
even poisonous; if these are indulged in,
the baby should be given only plain or barley water,
and the milk withdrawn and thrown away for one or
two nursings.</p>

<p>Before a nursing the mother should wash her hands
thoroughly with soap and hot water, and then wash the
nipples with a saturated boric solution. The feeding
should be done in a quiet room where there is no noise
or conversation to disturb the baby, and the mother
should be composed and relaxed. After the feeding,
give the baby a swallow of water to rinse out the
mouth. Wash the nipple again with the boric solution
and dry thoroughly with a clean towel. A triple fold
of clean, sterilized gauze, or surgeon’s lint, should be
pinned to the undervest, covering each nipple, thus
protecting both the nipple and the clothing; this
should be changed every day. Cleanliness will prevent
thrush in the baby’s mouth, and local soreness
and discomfort for the mother.</p>

<p>The quantity normal at a feeding will depend upon
the baby’s age, and consequently the size of his stomach
and the amount needed for his growth and maintenance.
(See page <a href="#Page_118">118</a>.) The quantity taken at one feeding
may be ascertained by weighing the baby just before
and just after a feeding.</p>

<p>Until recently, two-hour intervals for feeding were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
prescribed for babies at one or two months, with two
night feedings. Extensive studies in France and Germany
(where the raising of babies for replenishing the
army has made infant hygiene a subject of State investigation)
have proven that babies usually thrive
better on longer intervals, allowing time for the stomach
to rest. Some continental specialists advise four-hour
intervals from the beginning, and with some babies this
is quite satisfactory. The Table on page <a href="#Page_118">118</a> presents
the more usual schedule now recommended. It
provides for a three-hour schedule at the start, changing
to four hours at five months, with no feeding after
10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> The 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> feeding can usually be dropped
with advantage at about nine months. To drop a
feeding, substitute water for a few nights if the baby
wakes or cries.</p>

<p>Regularity is of the greatest importance in the feeding.
Clock schedule should be observed from the first
day and maintained thereafter. The digestive system
is much like a machine, pouring out its digestive fluids
at regular habitual intervals, and doing good work so
long as this regularity is respected and observed in the
feeding. Feeding the baby whenever he cries produces
indigestion, colic, irritability, self-indulgence.</p>

<p>Ten to fifteen minutes is the usual duration of a
feeding. The first milk is thinner, the latter part of
the nursing richer. Generally one breast is taken at
a feeding, the other breast at the succeeding feeding;
if the quantity in one is insufficient, both may be used
at one feeding. Neither the mother nor the baby
should go to sleep during the nursing. If the baby
dawdles, the food may be taken away until the next
time. He should stop a minute at the end of each five
minutes, to rest and breathe. If he regurgitates or
vomits up after nursing, he is being fed too much,
or the intervals are too short.</p>

<p>When the baby has finished, he should be handled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
very gently for the succeeding hour. His condition is
not unlike that of an uncorked bottle. He should lie
or sit quietly without jolting or rocking, much less
tumbling or other vigorous manipulations. Lay, him
on his right side if he is inclined to eructation; on
the left side in diarrhea or intestinal trouble, to open
the rectal valves and allow gas to escape.</p>

<p>Between feedings, the baby should be given pure
water, 65° to 70° F., at regular intervals, several times
a day; or during the night if he cries. It can be given
the first month from a sterilized medicine dropper, then
from a spoon; the use of a cup may begin at five or
six months.</p>

<p>If the water is not perfectly pure, it should be boiled
twenty minutes; to remove sediment, strain through
several thicknesses of sterilized cheesecloth.</p>

<p>Strained orange juice or prune juice, without sugar,
at first diluted one half with water, may be given daily
at six months, or earlier if the baby is constipated.
Begin with one teaspoonful and gradually increase to
four tablespoonfuls at six months. It should be given
an hour before feeding time.</p>

<p>At six months a scraped, clean chicken or chop bone
(after being cooked) may be given once or twice a day,
a quarter hour before feeding, to exercise the jaws
(being very careful that it is not dropped on the floor).
At ten months this may be replaced once a day by a
hard crust to be sucked after feeding, watching that
the baby does not break off any pieces, or removing
these from his mouth.</p>

<p>No other food should ordinarily be given until nine
months, when weaning may usually begin by substituting
for one nursing a feeding of milk and strained
cereal, given with a spoon or from a cup. The formula
should be prescribed by the physician or dietitian.
Whether a baby should be completely weaned at nine
months or at twelve will depend upon the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the baby, quality of the mother’s milk, and the season.
The baby and the milk should be examined, and the
physician’s or dietitian’s advice followed. Starch is
not normally digested under nine months; solid food or
lumps may cause convulsions.</p>

<p><b>Stools.</b> There should be at least one normal movement
every day; some babies have two or three.</p>

<p>Begin the second week to establish regularity.</p>

<p>A movement is most likely to follow a feeding in
early morning and the afternoon.</p>

<p>Normal stools are yellow, soft, and smooth.</p>

<p>If gray or brown, with mucus, blood, or undigested
food, report to the physician.</p>

<p>If green or with foul odor, report immediately and
substitute barley water for feedings. Spinach will cause
green stools, or they may turn green an hour after removal;
this is normal.</p>

<p>Keep the bowels in good condition by giving plenty
of water, fruit juice, and abdominal exercises; avoid
enemas, suppositories, and laxative drugs, all of which
are detrimental.</p>

<p><b>Sleep.</b> During his first year this should be the baby’s
chief occupation. Any period of rapid growth involves
much work on the part of all internal organs,
and a low power of resistance. In this twelve months,
the weight trebles, and the length increases about one
half; the brain increases its weight nearly three times,
and has by far more work in learning new adjustments
than in any similar period later in life.</p>

<p>The amount of sleep required at different stages is
shown in the table on page <a href="#Page_118">118</a>.</p>

<p>The baby should always have his own bed, and if
possible, his own room. He should preferably sleep
outdoors except (1) in rain or falling snow, (2) damp,
fogging weather, (3) with snow melting, (4) dusty,
windy weather, (5) temperature below 40° F. or above
90°. The night air is as healthful as that of the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
with these same provisions. A sleeping porch is an
investment that will pay high dividends all through his
life.</p>

<p>In dry, still weather, 68° to 95° F., the baby may be
taken outdoors two or three days after his arrival;
otherwise he must gradually be accustomed to the cooler
outer air by being taken into a room with windows
open on one side (wrapping him up judiciously),
reducing the temperature every few days, until at
one month he is breathing a temperature of 65° F.,
at two months of 55° F., and at three months, he can
breathe it nearly at freezing (32° F.). Abrupt changes
should be carefully avoided. Pure cold air is invigorating;
stale air is poisonous; air too dry injures
the mucous membrane of the nose and throat; air
too moist is oppressive; all of these develop colds and
pneumonia.</p>

<p>When the baby is indoors, there should be a constant,
quiet current of fresh air, except during dressing and
bathing. The air should be regulated, not by guess, but
by a reliable thermometer (tested at the baby’s head),
and the equally important hygrometer for humidity,
when there is not a constant intake of fresh, outside air.</p>

<p>The room temperature should not exceed 70° F.
the first three months, and 68° F. later, when the baby
is dressed. It may advantageously thereafter be
65°-68° ordinarily. When the baby is sleeping, or
playing with wraps on, it is of vital value to have it
lower, graduating it from 40° to 60° according to circumstances.
Cold air is vitalizing; warm air is
devitalizing. An open fireplace, with one window
lowered from the top, or a six-inch window board for
very cold or windy weather, will provide reasonable
ventilation.</p>

<p>A baby has more room and sleeps more comfortably
in his basket or crib than in a carriage. When awake,
he needs more space to roll, kick, creep, walk. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
open country, he is much better off on the veranda or
in the nursery with windows open, lying in his basket
or pen, than rolled up in a carriage. Babies unfortunately
housed in city apartments or crowded tenements
must sometimes be confined in a carriage for
the sake of getting to the open air. In a sunny, open-aired
room or by an open window is better for a baby
than down in a dusty street. The air at higher levels
has less dust and fewer germs. The roof of an apartment
house, if there is protection from chimney gas,
hot sun, and high winds, is preferable to the street.
He should never be put on the ground without the protection
of a waterproof and blanket or rug to prevent
chilling.</p>

<p><b>Making and Care of Bed.</b> Lay in the mattress—preferably
a washable folded quilt, laid smooth, or a
floss, hair, or straw-filled mattress.</p>

<p>Cover mattress with papricloth nursery blanket or
light-weight rubber sheeting, laid smooth.</p>

<p>Over this, lay the large quilted pad or felting.</p>

<p>Lay on the lower sheet, tucking it under the mattress.</p>

<p>Lay a small quilted pad under the baby’s hips, or
use a large size pad for older, tossing babies.</p>

<p>Lay a flat quilted or hair pad (which may be covered
with a cotton or linen slip) or a folded diaper or soft
folded towel for the head and face; a pillow is inadvisable.</p>

<p>Put on the top sheet and the coverlet, folding the
sheet back six inches over the top of the coverlet for
protection, and tucking in at sides (not tight) and at
foot.</p>

<p>For cold weather, especially outdoors, put in first a
woolen blanket. Lay several newspapers between
this and the mattress, and when the baby is in, fasten
this over the coverlet like a sleeping bag; for cold
weather a knit or woolen sleeping bag is desirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>When the baby is out of his bed, it should be taken
apart, both morning and afternoon, shaken, thoroughly
aired, and sunned.</p>

<p>In cold weather, the bed should be warmed before
putting the baby in, and flannelette may well be used
instead of muslin sheets.</p>

<p>Change sheets and pads whenever they are wet.</p>

<p>The crib bed is cared for in the same way. Padded
side protectors should not be used, as they prevent
good ventilation. The light-weight, washable side
curtains may be used, but these on only one side and
end; they should be removed and washed every week.
The screen will furnish ample protection from drafts.</p>

<p>The bed should always be placed where it has a
quiet current of fresh air but not a draft, strong wind,
or hot sun. The basket should rest firmly on its stand,
or a large table, or dry surface, never on the floor.
Protection should be provided against flies, mosquitoes,
cats, dogs, falling objects; and after eight months,
against the baby’s climbing and falling out.</p>

<p>“Putting the baby to sleep” should consist in laying
the baby in his stationary bed,—warm, dry, comfortable,
protected,—to go to sleep by himself.
Rocking disturbs the circulation in the brain, produces
only light sleep, and is bad for the nervous system.
Babies often cry at first, when laid in bed, merely to be
taken up, rocked, or played with. To humor them
in this way is to cultivate in them self-indulgence,
irritable temper, and tyranny. If let alone they may
cry themselves to sleep for a few nights, but this will
do them no physical harm; they will have learned
their lesson, and the family will be spared further
trouble.</p>

<p>The baby should not always be laid on his back, but
may be laid on one side, or on his stomach, turning his
head to one side and putting a flat pad under his chest.
The latter position is not only a restful change, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
also promotes digestion and encourages development
of the muscles at the base of the head and in the upper
back.</p>

<p>Disturbed sleep may be caused by bad air, overclothing,
rough clothing, cold feet, indigestion, thirst,
need of circumcision, a habit of rocking. It is not
necessary to keep the house in silence while the baby
is sleeping. Sudden and boisterous noise should be
avoided, but the baby outdoors or in his own room
learns to sleep undisturbed by ordinary conversation,
music, household activities.</p>

<p>The baby should be gently wakened, if asleep at
feeding or bath time. After a few weeks, his system
will be so trained that he will naturally waken at these
times.</p>

<p>The regular waking of the baby should be anticipated,
and the mother or nurse should be there at the
time to take him up, change the diaper, and make
him comfortable before he begins to cry. Waking time
should be a smiling time.</p>

<p><b>Play and Exercise.</b> The first play is simple, muscular
play of limbs.</p>

<p>After the first month, arrange clothing and covers
so there is great freedom for kicking, twisting, rolling,
stretching, pulling.</p>

<p>After two months, baby will not sleep so much and
will be more active with hands, arms, legs.</p>

<p>He should have a pen or yard, raised six inches above
the floor; or a board may be made to fit over mattress
of crib. Pen or board should have woolen blanket
and quilted pad over it; let baby kick and roll freely.
The floor is bad because of drafts and dust. A large
dry-goods box, raised, is better than the floor.</p>

<p>Do not prop a baby up in a sitting position until
he is strong enough to hold himself up five minutes
without support; then allow sitting position for only
ten minutes at a time, not on the table or bed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
feet extended in front, but in a carriage or chair, legs
bent at knee.</p>

<p>After two months place objects for him to grasp
toward, upward, and forward.</p>

<p>As soon as the baby learns to smile, this becomes a
little game. At six or eight months, he begins to play
with vocal sounds, at peek-a-boo and pat-a-cake.
Boisterous play, tossing, tumbling, tickling, are too
severe for the delicate nerves; his laughing at this is
a symptom rather of nervousness than of joy. The
baby is not a plaything for his elders. The hour before
bedtime is a good time for quiet mothering.</p>

<p>Motor development during the first year normally
approximates the following plan.</p>

<p>Eyes begin to focus at about six weeks; coördination
not well developed until three months or later; real
tears, from the lachrymal glands, begin at about three
months; knows mother or nurse by sight at about
three months. Voluntary smiling begins at about five
weeks, laughing at five or six months. Ability to sit
alone develops at from six to eight months, to stand
alone at twelve to fourteen, and to walk alone at fourteen
to eighteen months.</p>

<p><b>Exercises.</b> Special exercise may begin at three or
four weeks of age. Begin with one exercise, and three-minute
periods. Each fortnight time may be increased
two minutes up to twenty-minute limit. Add new
exercises gradually, at two-week intervals.</p>

<p>All exercises should be given slowly, rhythmically,
two hours after a feeding, when baby is in happy mood;
before bathing in mid-morning, or in mid-afternoon, is
a good time. Do not permit fatigue or test endurance.</p>

<p>Always do the exercises in the same order, thus
cultivating motor memory.</p>

<p>Lay the child on the padded nursery table; have
clothing loose, or preferably without clothing; diaper
unfastened; no drafts; temperature at 70° to 72° F.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p><em>Arm movements.</em> For development of chest, upper
back, upper arms.</p>

<p>1. Take hold of each hand; extend arms straight
on table, at right angles to body, saying “down”,
4 times; bring hands together in front of body as in
clapping, saying “up”, 4 times. (Figures 1, 2.)</p>

<p>2. At “down”, bring arms down to sides, parallel
with body; at “up” stretch arms upward to table
above the head (if baby objects, each arm may be done
separately) 4 times. Keep his elbows straight in both
exercises. (Figure 4.)</p>

<p><em>Leg movements.</em> For trunk and leg muscles; overcoming
constipation.</p>

<p>1. Grasp foot, bend knee to body; do alternately
with right and left, each 4 times; then both together
4 times. (Figure 3.)</p>

<p>2. Grasp leg, keep knee straight, bring leg to right
angles with body; take each leg alternately, 4 times;
then together, 4 times. Avoid sidewise movement.
(Figures 5, 6.)</p>

<p>When the child is able to lift his head, he may be
allowed to pull himself up as far as he can, holding the
nurse’s hands. Grasp his hands firmly so he will not
suddenly lose his hold and fall back; do not pull him,
but let him develop strength to pull himself to a sitting
position. (Figures 7, 8.)</p>

<p>At first let him immediately lower himself to lying
position, gradually sitting up one minute, and slowly
increasing by one minute.</p>

<p>Many babies at about eleven months go on all fours,
bear-fashion. At this stage the wheelbarrow exercise
can begin, grasping the baby’s feet and lifting them
up while he supports himself on his hands and arms.
This is strengthening for arms, chest, back, and trunk.
At this age the substituting of rompers for dresses permits
more freedom of action and minimizes accidents
from tumbling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p><b>Crying.</b> Every baby does some crying, and every
cry has some meaning. The wise mother will find the
cause and will, if necessary, remove it. She will
never use pacifiers, sugar, soothing syrups, loud noise,
trotting, bouncing, tossing, irregular feeding, all of
which are injurious to the baby’s sensitive nerves.</p>

<p>A pernicious habit of self-indulgence and tyranny is
cultivated if the baby learns that he can get his desires
by crying. If indulged, even at a few weeks of
age, he develops temper, self-indulgence, and disrespect
for authority. If no attention is paid to such crying,
or desires cried for are denied, he soon learns self-control,
self-reliance, respect for law and authority.</p>

<p>To state the underlying causes of infant mortality
and defects is at the same time to emphasize their
preventability and to indicate the method of prevention.
The pathos is less in the high rate of death and
illness than in their needlessness,—if only young
women and young men were provided with even a
meager preparation for this responsibility! The following
are representative judgments expressed repeatedly
by physicians everywhere.</p>

<p>“The problem of infant mortality is not one of
sanitation alone or housing or indeed of poverty as
such, but is mainly a question of motherhood.”</p>

<p class="right">
—Doctor G. Newman (English).<br>
</p>

<p>“The parents in their homes are largely responsible
for the high infant mortality.”</p>

<p class="right">
—Doctor Ira S. Wile (American).<br>
</p>

<p>It is advisable to have the baby examined by the
physician once a week during the first three months
and at least once a month thereafter during the first
year. If the daily régime is followed carefully, with
judgment, the baby will probably gain normally in
weight, be rosy and happy, free from any illness. The
first year is the critical year, the time for every precaution
both to prevent defects and promote vigor.</p>

<p><b>The Foundations of Efficiency.</b> It is the business of
the home to develop in children such vitality that they
will enjoy exuberant health in childhood, acquire
habits of good hygiene, lay the foundation for endurance,
beauty, and longevity in manhood and womanhood,
and bequeath vigor of constitution to their
children. The slogan is “Prevention—Vitality—Efficiency.”</p>

<p>For efficiency the organs must be approximately perfect,
and their functioning sure and strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>The ultimate physical sources of power are:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>1. Good nutrition and sound digestion</li>
<li>2. Sound, active lungs</li>
<li>3. Vigorous kidneys</li>
<li>4. Strong heart</li>
<li>5. Steady nervous system</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, there must be ample intake of food and oxygen,
thorough removal of waste, quick distribution of fuel,
oxygen, and waste, economical working of the organism.
The whole body must be organically sound, and all its
functions must go on efficiently and vigorously.</p>

<p><b>Developing Vitality to Resist Disease.</b> Disease may
be due to:</p>

<p>a. Some defect of structure in an organ as the heart,
spinal column, eye, tooth</p>

<p>b. Ineffective functioning of an organ or system, as
in constipation, slow circulation, shallow breathing</p>

<p>c. Low resistance to disease germs or poisons, as
in the contracting of influenza, diarrhea, pneumonia,
whooping cough</p>

<h3>The Means for Developing Vitality.</h3>

<p>1. Good nutrition. This involves sound digestion
and assimilation. It can be assured only through:</p>

<p>
a. Wholesome foods, adapted to the age in quantity and preparation</p>
<p>b. Sound teeth</p>
<p>c. Regularity in feeding</p>
<p>d. Right conditions in feeding</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Eating slowly</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Chewing well</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Avoiding severe exercise within an hour after feeding</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Eating not less than 1 to 3 hours before bedtime</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Eating in a cheerful frame of mind</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Food at approximately body temperature</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>2. Thorough elimination of waste.</p>

<p>a. Through the lungs by oxidization. Deep and
adequate breathing accomplishes the two ends of eliminating
some of the poisonous waste (as carbon dioxide
from the lungs) and bringing quantities of oxygen to
the internal cells for burning up of waste. Active physical
exercise and the habit of deep breathing are both
necessary.</p>

<p>b. Through kidneys and intestines. These are Nature’s
plumbing system for removing poisonous waste.
Regularity in these functions should become a habit in
early childhood. There should be a bowel movement
once or twice a day. Abundance of laxative foods in
the diet, water between meals, outdoor life and activity,
are natural means of regulating these functions.</p>


<p>3. Regulation of bodily heat. Colds and chills
pave the way for vital disorders. They are not always
symptoms of an infection. They are often due to
poor training of the nerves in the skin to respond quickly
to changes of temperature. The training of these
nerves can come only as that of any other nerves—through
their exercise. Indoor and sedentary life
does not supply sufficient exercise for them; for this
exercise there is required:</p>

<p>a. A low slightly variable temperature, 65°-68° F.
indoor</p>

<p>b. Perceptible air current</p>

<p>c. Air baths, sun baths, and cold-water baths administered
with judgment</p>

<p>4. Good circulation of blood. The blood is the
only avenue by which nourishment can be brought to
the cells or their poisonous waste removed. So far
as it can be directly controlled, circulation may be
quickened by abundance of exercise, cool temperature,
wise distribution of porous clothing. The child should
be taught how to quickly warm hands or feet by special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
exercise, rolling or shaking of hands, stretching the
arms and forcefully opening and shutting the hands,
slowly rising and sinking on the feet, running, alternately
stretching the toes and heels, rubbing the feet.</p>

<p>5. Protection of nose, throat, and chest. Nature
has provided the nose with a delicate mucous lining
that constantly secretes a fluid which has the power to
destroy germs that may enter with the air. If this
moist mucous lining becomes dry, it cannot function.
It will not become dry unless the indoor air is too dry,
as is the case in artificially heated rooms unless additional
moisture is supplied by open dishes of water and
by constant intake of outer air. The throat likewise
suffers in a dry atmosphere.</p>

<p>Bundling the throat and chest keeps the skin moist
and makes it more susceptible to congestion; they
should be made resistant to congestion by deep
breathing and daily cold sponging. Adenoids and
enlarged tonsils are abnormal growths of lymphatic
tissue in the nose and throat that make breathing
difficult and inefficient, and that become breeding
places for germs. The infection that they harbor
leads frequently to colds, earache, deafness, tonsillitis,
diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever. They obstruct the
breathing and reduce the supply of oxygen, spoil the
shape of the face, reduce the ability to think, and by
their discomfort produce irritability and nervousness.
They greatly interfere with the vitality. Adenoids
should therefore be removed, and tonsils treated, their
removal being a last resort when they are diseased.</p>

<p>6. Maintaining high count and efficiency of red
blood corpuscles and of leucocytes in the blood. The
red blood corpuscles carry oxygen. Evident symptoms
of their inefficiency are paleness, low vitality, inertia.
The leucocytes are the special blood cells that attack
disease germs which have made their way past the
sentinels in the nose, throat, and stomach. The number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
and efficiency of these bodyguards is increased by
outdoor exercise, cold-water baths, air baths, sun baths,
by adding more mineral food to the diet.</p>

<p>Additional means of preventing development of
germ diseases are: (a) protection from contagion;
(b) injecting of antitoxins. The greatest preventive,
however, is internal resistance, since disease germs are
usually in the atmosphere and are entering the system
every day through the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>7. Storing of nervous energy. This is possible only
through abundant sleep, regularity of regimen, temperance,
moderation, self-control, avoidance of stimulants,
narcotics, or dissipation. Nature has intended
that childhood shall be a period of accumulating and
conserving nervous reserve.</p>

<p>The effect of any regimen or any exception to a principle
of good hygiene must be measured not simply by
its immediate results but even more by its remote consequences.
Nature is patient, long suffering, and will
endure much abuse without great protest, but Nature is
also an accurate bookkeeper and remorseless creditor;
every debt must at some time be paid on demand,—it
may be five, ten, forty years later, or in the lives
of the succeeding generation. Nature makes no allowance
for ignorance of her laws. Parental love cannot
atone for lack of knowledge or experience. The death-rate
from tuberculosis rises considerably among girls
in their twenties. To what extent is this due to general
poor hygiene, indoor life, lack of exercise, in
childhood? During the last quarter century there has
been a marked increase in the death-rate during middle
age from kidney disorders, cancer, heart disease,
insanity. It may well be asked to what extent these
are due to habits of irregularity, overfeeding, wrong
feeding, self-indulgence, nervousness, acquired in childhood.</p>

<p><b>Sleep.</b> <em>Quantity.</em> All the sleep a child can get is so
much of fortification against the inevitable stress of
later years, as well as conducive to his immediate
vitality, comfort, and good nature. Children vary

<p><em>Conditions.</em> 1. Bed alone. No one can sleep as
comfortably or restfully with another person as alone.
With little children, moral as well as physiological
possibilities are to be considered.</p>

<p>2. Room alone, if possible, especially for children
under six, that they may not be disturbed.</p>

<p>3. Outdoors if possible, on a sleeping porch, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
bedding protected from dampness, and provision made
for first warming the bed at night in cold weather.</p>

<p>4. Room cool and with current of outside air, if
sleeping indoors. Temperature not above 60° F.
and may be as low as 50° F. to advantage for normal
children over six months, or 32° F. without harm, with
ample bedding and warm night clothes. Warm
wrapper or shawl should be provided to wrap around
the child when taken out of bed.</p>

<p>5. Children beyond infancy (1½ years) should have
their supper an hour before bedtime until eight or
nine years of age, and thereafter two hours before bedtime.
Children should be taken up for the toilet at a
regular hour, either nine or ten o’clock, until six or
eight years of age, to prevent bed-wetting or disturbed
sleep.</p>

<p>6. Every condition should be provided for complete
relaxation and sound sleep, not light semi-sleep.
Among these conditions, besides the foregoing, are:</p>

<p>Lights extinguished in sleeping room;</p>

<p>Stationary bed that does not rock;</p>

<p>Story-telling before child is undressed, not after he is
in bed, that the mind may not be filled with vivid
images, or brain congested, when trying to sleep.</p>

<p>Evening stories should be quiet, restful, happy,
without gruesome, melodramatic, exciting, or sad atmosphere.</p>

<p>Chanting, humming, rhythmic singing, is relaxing,
and five or ten minutes of this after child is in bed may
be advantageous, especially with nervous or unruly
children.</p>

<p>Massaging down the back, in long slow strokes, Will
relieve the congestion of the brain.</p>

<p>Give the child one toy to occupy his hands; prohibit
more than one, to prevent mental activity.</p>

<p>Bedtime should not be a time of punishment, recalling
of misdeeds, scolding; leave that until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
child is most vital, in mid-morning or afternoon.
Bedtime should be a quiet, happy time.</p>

<p>A thought impressed upon the child as he is falling
to sleep, or directly after, especially if it is repeated
for some days or weeks, is absorbed by the subconscious
mind and has profound influence upon motives
and action. The suggestion may be given aloud to
the conscious mind while the child is still awake, or
repeated softly or thought intensively, after the conscious
mind is dulled by sleepiness.</p>

<p>The child should learn, from early babyhood, to go
to sleep by himself, without a light, with the door
closed. This is a most important training in self-reliance.</p>

<p>If these conditions are observed, sleep should be
restful and undisturbed. Possible disturbing conditions
may include constipation, indigestion, intestinal
worms, nervousness. The matter should be reported
to the physician. Bed-wetting may be overcome by
taking the child up during the night, by giving no
liquid after four o’clock, by promise of rewards, by
mental suggestion. Circumcision may be needed.
Punishment is worse than useless.</p>

<p><em>The Afternoon Nap.</em> The same general conditions
should be provided. The room or sleeping porch
should be darkened, and ample ventilation and light
covering provided. The outer clothing, shoes, stockings
should be removed, and nightgown put on over
the underwear; or the child may be completely undressed
as at night. If the child is disinclined to sleep
at nap time, use the spinal sponging with warm water,
the spinal massage, and undress completely as at night.
Even if the child does not sleep, he will receive the
much-needed relaxation, and the resting of spine and
heart, the work of which is greatly reduced while lying
down.</p>

<p><em>Waking.</em> The waking time should always be anticipated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
and some one should be at hand to take the
child at once to the toilet, to speak to him and reassure
him. This is important both for physical and moral
reasons. Waking should be a happy time.</p>

<p><b>Clothing.</b> Clothing should be comfortable to body
and mind; it should provide freedom of action and
thought, cultivate modesty, simplicity, democracy,
daintiness, avoiding self-consciousness or vanity.</p>

<p>Too much clothing keeps the skin moist, and is a
cause of colds.</p>

<p>Distribute clothing judiciously; avoid overclothing
trunk and chest, underclothing legs.</p>

<p><em>Underclothing.</em> Use light-weight underwear and
give additional warmth by extra wraps as needed.
Adapt clothing to the actual weather conditions, not
to traditions of seasons. Avoid sudden changes, as
from heavy play suit to thin suit.</p>

<p>Underclothing may be all cotton or part wool.</p>

<p>Porous clothing is warm, holding a protecting layer
of air; thick woven clothing is cold, preventing the
evaporation of moisture from the skin. For hot
weather use sleeveless or half-sleeve gauze vests.</p>

<p>Use side elastics to support the stockings, never the
round garters. Select carefully the waist for attaching
supporters; the “Ideal” waist is excellent.</p>

<p>Protect the ankles and legs with stockings or leggings
in cold or changeable weather.</p>

<p>Keep the throat open, except in very cold weather,
and then protect lightly.</p>

<p>Shoes and stockings should keep the feet warm and
comfortable, not perspiring, cold, restricted.</p>

<p><em>Night clothes.</em> A complete change should be made at
night. After three years a shirt is not needed at night,
except in very cold weather. When diapers are no
longer needed, the nightdrawers may be worn, using
those with feet for cold weather. For outdoor sleeping
in cool weather a sleeping-bag of eiderdown is desirable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
and a light hood. A flannel or eiderdown bathrobe
and slippers should be provided for emergency and
morning use.</p>

<p><em>Care.</em> Begin to teach the child at one year to put
his shoes neatly together; by two years to lay his
clothes neatly when taken off, and to hang up wraps;
by three years to fold; by four years to take care of
all clothing as removed and keep his chiffonier in order.
Provide low hooks and small, low, easy-working bureau
drawers within reach of the child.</p>

<p>Keep soiled clothing in a ventilated receptacle, out
of the sleeping room or kitchen.</p>

<p>Keep hats and wraps well brushed; shoes brushed
and cleaned; after five years, children should care
for shoes.</p>

<p>Readymade clothing should be washed before wearing.
Much readymade clothing, whether cheap or expensive,
is made in sweatshops and crowded tenements.</p>

<p>Children’s play clothes should be of such durable
material and simple design that play may not be
hampered through fear of soiling or injuring garments.</p>

<br>

<p>Ample size is especially important with growing children,
and easily overlooked or neglected as they outgrow
their clothes. Rubber in legs of readymade
rompers is always too tight, and is better removed.</p>

<p><b>Bathing.</b> Each child should have his own wash
cloths and towels. Have a separate wash cloth and
towel for the face, another cloth and Turkish towel for
the body. Dry and sun wash cloths every day; boil
them weekly.</p>

<p>Temperature of bathroom about 70° F. (65-70),
with no drafts. Before the child is undressed, have
everything ready, including the clothing to be put on.</p>

<p>Water and soap are irritating to eczema; use oil or,
occasionally, water bath with bran.</p>

<p><em>The Cold Bath.</em> The daily cold bath is of vital importance
in training the skin to react quickly to temperatures,
increasing the circulation, increasing the
white blood corpuscles, and maintaining a high degree
of vitality and resistance to illness, especially to colds,
croup, coughs, pneumonia, and tuberculosis.</p>

<p>By careful attention to details, the cold bath can
be given with a minimum of shock, and children enjoy
it. It should be made as enjoyable as possible, and
persisted in, even under protest. It should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
given, however, in a cold room. If the child has a
cold, or the skin is cold and clammy, it should be given
only to the throat, chest, and back. If the child is in
a low vital condition, or does not react well otherwise,
it may be preceded by a quick hot bath (98°-100°F.)
to furnish body heat. The mildest form is to give it
while the child lies in bed, quickly bathing and drying
one part at a time. Ordinarily it can be given as follows,
the whole procedure, including rubbing, not
taking more than five minutes.</p>

<p>Let the child jump, run, or exercise vigorously for
a few minutes before beginning the bath. Remove
clothing and give a vigorous allover rub with hands or
Turkish towels, rubbing from extremities toward the
heart; let the child help in this and do it himself after
four years. The child may stand with his feet in lukewarm
water, or on a bath mat, not on a cold surface.</p>

<p>Temperature of the water should be at least down to
70° F. and as much lower as the child can take and
react well. Salt (1 tablespoon to quart of water) gives
a better reaction and lower range. Tepid water gives
no tonic and may leave a chilly reaction. Have the
wash cloth wet but not dripping. Wash quickly in
the following order: (1) hand, arms; (2) neck, chest;
(3) back, beginning at lower end; (4) legs, beginning
with soles of feet; (5) abdomen. In this way the reflexes
are bathed first, and the feeling of shock reduced,
but the same valuable tonic results obtained. Dry
quickly, rubbing with Turkish towels and hands. In
cold weather, or if the skin is very dry, rub in quickly
a little cocoa butter, olive oil, or cold cream. A spray
with weak force, or pouring from a cup may begin in the
second year; a strong spray or shower not until the
fifth year.</p>

<p><em>The Warm Bath.</em> For cleansing, the warm bath is
needed two or three times a week in winter, and every
day in hot weather. The body surface is relatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
greater in children than in adults, and because of their
greater activity and more rapid circulation, a relatively
greater quantity of perspiration and waste material is
constantly being poured out upon the skin. If this is
not removed, it clogs the pores and thus keeps poisons
within the body and prevents the normal absorption of
oxygen through the skin.</p>

<p>The warm bath is best given at night, as a tub bath,
before the supper, or an hour afterwards. When the
bath is not given, the neck, ears, armpits, hands, and
feet should be well washed. The water temperature
should be 96°-98° F. A mild oil soap should be used
moderately, such as Castile or Palmolive. The bath
should be given in three minutes. Let the children
splash in the tub for another three minutes, trying to
swim. Always follow with the cold water to close the
pores and prevent colds. This may be poured into the
tub, to reduce the temperature to about 70°, or poured
from a pitcher, or given with a spray, at 70°-80°, or
given as a quick sponge at that temperature. Dry
quickly and thoroughly, putting on a wrap to avoid
chilling. If the child sleeps outdoors, the bath should
be given an hour before bedtime in cool weather, or the
oil rub may be given instead of water bath.</p>

<p>In hot weather children may have three or four
sponge baths at 70°-80° during the day, or five-minute
splashes in the tub at due intervals after meals.</p>

<p>The daily air bath is as much needed as the water,
and should be given, with exercise and rubbing, if
the water bath cannot be taken at the regular time.
It is a tonic for the skin and gives the exercise to the
nerves that cultivates resistance against colds.</p>

<p><em>Sun Baths.</em> Sun baths, judiciously given, are also of
great vitalizing value. In warm weather (70°-90° F.)
children should be allowed to play outdoors with
minimum of clothing, as sandals, white rompers or
bathing trunks, and a light sun hat, for several hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
a day, avoiding exposure of too hot sun (over 80°).
Children not accustomed to this must begin gradually
and may have a preliminary oil rub, to prevent either
chill or sunburn. In cool weather, this may be given
in the house, although the benefits are not so great, as
the most effective (the violet) rays do not penetrate
through glass. White or light colored clothing permits
the penetration of light rays to the skin, and dark clothing
prevents this; the former, therefore, is of greater
vitalizing value. The sun and light baths are of great
therapeutic value with nervous or anemic children.
The tanning of the skin gives remarkable resistance.</p>

<p>The development of resistance through judicious use
of baths and light, combined with deep breathing, would
greatly reduce the mortality from colds, pneumonia,
tuberculosis, which are the chief causes of death after
infancy.</p>

<p><b>The Hands.</b> Cleanliness of the hands is highly important
both for sanitary and moral reasons. Therefore
teach the child from babyhood, by example and
precept, to always wash the hands:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Before touching food, either for eating, serving,
or preparation, as a safeguard against infection</p>

<p>2. After eating, to prevent soiling of clothes, furniture,
toys</p>

<p>3. After going to the toilet</p>

<p>4. Before going to bed</p>

<p>5. Before touching the eyes</p>
</div>

<p>The finger nails should be cleaned with an orange
stick once a day, and before meals whenever dirty.
To prevent hangnails, press the cuticle back around
the nail every day. Trim finger nails round. A soft
hand brush and Hand Sapolio, almond meal, or corn
meal may be necessary for very dirty hands. Always
dry thoroughly to prevent chapping, and in cold
weather apply a lotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p><b>The Feet.</b> Wash the feet every night when a bath is
not given. Dry thoroughly between the toes. Perspiration
is acid and soon causes soreness if it remains.
Once a week trim the nails, cutting straight. If the
feet are cold, put in cold (75°-80°F.) or hot (96°) water
for three minutes, apply a 25 per cent. solution of alcohol,
rubbing dry. If cold from exposure, always use the
cold water. Chronically cold feet indicate wrong shoes,
poor general circulation, or need of more exercise for
feet. Corns, callouses, bunions, or misshapen toes
can be prevented by using shoes that are comfortable
and adapted to the shape of the foot.</p>

<p>The strength of the arch should be increased by foot
exercises: (1) Rising slowly on the toes and slowly
descending, keeping the weight of the body on the soles;
(2) Alternately stretching the toes and the heel;
(3) Massaging the ankles. Braces in the shoe prevent
development of ankle muscles. Braces and arch supporters
should be worn only on the advice and prescription
of a physician, if possible, an orthopedic specialist.
Much harm may be done by their wrong use.</p>

<p><b>Care of the Hair.</b> During the second year the head
should be washed two or three times a week, or oftener
if scurf appears. Use Castile or Palmolive soap and
rinse thoroughly to remove all soap and prevent formation
of scurf. If a crust appears, gently rub in fresh
lard, olive oil, or liquid vaseline at night, and wash off
in morning; never use a comb or harsh rubbing to
remove. During the third and fourth year shampoo
weekly, and thereafter every two or three weeks.</p>

<p>The shampoo should be given in the daytime, when
there is ample time and means for drying quickly and
thoroughly, preferably in the sun. The scalp should
be massaged five or ten minutes every day, through
childhood, to promote good circulation in the scalp
and keep it loose and clean, and the hair brushed thoroughly
to remove dust. This is Nature’s own tonic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
and more effective than any bought at the drugstore.
If the hair is thin, olive or cocoanut oil or vaseline
rubbed into the scalp will stimulate new growth. Going
without a hat (except, of course, in cold weather or
hot sun) is beneficial for the hair. The hairbrush should
be soft, and brush and comb should be cleaned every
week. Tangles should be patiently and gently brushed
out; braiding will prevent them.</p>

<p>Curly or straight hair is hereditary, and curls can
be only temporarily produced in naturally straight
hair. Heated irons, metal curlers, tightly rolled curlers,
dampening the hair, are all injurious. For curling, only
soft rags, or kid, on which the hair is loosely rolled,
should be used, and these not applied at night around
the head, to interfere with comfort in sleep.</p>

<p>When hair is trimmed, it should not be shaved off
close at the base of the head, as is sometimes the fashion,
leaving this most sensitive part of the head and neck
suddenly and unduly exposed.</p>

<p>If the eyelashes or eyebrows are short, stubby, rough,
light, they may be improved and darkened by daily
application of vaseline, and brushing with a soft, narrow
toothbrush. Such attention adds greatly to the
beauty and expressiveness of the face, and will be a
cause of much gratitude in later years.</p>

<p><b>Nose.</b> The nose should be kept clean. For children
under four, it should be cleaned every morning with the
liquid vaseline or warm water, using a sterile piece of
twisted gauze which is immediately wrapped in paper
and disposed of. Repeat at night and during the
day, if the nose is not clean. At three years, children
should be able to blow the nose, and this should be
a regular part of toilet-making both morning and
evening.</p>

<p>In blowing the nose, one side should be held closed,
while the other side is blown. To blow both sides at
once produces pressure in the ears that may cause injury.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Nasal douches are to be avoided except in illness
and by the physician’s orders.</p>

<p>Avoid (1) dusty air, as in the city streets, or in a room
that is being cleaned; (2) overdry air, as in artificially
heated rooms. Both of these are thought to promote
adenoids. The former contains many disease germs.
The latter drys the mucous membrane, preventing,
therefore, its work of germ destruction, and producing
uncomfortable, cracked membrane.</p>

<p><b>Throat.</b> The throat is strengthened by the daily
cold bathing of neck and chest. A child can learn to
gargle at three or four years, and is then able to do it
easily if soreness develops.</p>

<p><b>Ears.</b> Wash the ears every day with warm water,
making sure that no dirt remains in creases or behind
the lobes. If wax accumulates, remove it with the
twisted end of the wash cloth or gauze. Never put
sharp instruments of any kind in the ear.</p>

<p>The lining of the inner ear is a continuation of the
lining of the nose and throat. If the latter becomes
infected, as with a cold, directly or from enlarged
tonsils or adenoids, the infection is likely to continue
into the ears, causing running ears, which may result
in deafness.</p>

<p>The ears should not be made sensitive by cotton stuffing
or ear muffs. In very cold weather, little children
should wear a hood, and older children may do so with
temperature below 40° F.</p>

<p>Never pull the ear lobe nor strike a child on the
head; it may cause deafness. Teach children that
blowing or shouting into the ear may produce deafness.</p>

<p><b>Teeth.</b> After the first six teeth are cut, during the
first year, it is advisable to have a small, soft brush
to use with water, plain or with boric acid or bicarbonate
of soda, after each feeding. This never should
be neglected after eighteen months. Doctor Truby
King advises giving the child a raw apple, a third of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
which has been peeled, and which is partially bruised
until softened, following the midday feeding, after one
year of age; munching this for ten minutes is a natural
and effective method of cleaning the teeth. By four
years of age, the child should be able to brush his teeth
himself. Salt, bicarbonate of soda, or milk of magnesia
are effective dentrifices. Patent pastes, powders, and
liquids are expensive and of no more efficacy than the
foregoing, their chief value probably consisting in the
incentive they give to the use of the brush.</p>

<p>In brushing, the motion should be up and down, and
rotary, as well as across the teeth; the inner and upper
as well as the outer surfaces and the gums should be
brushed. To safeguard against infection, teeth should
not be cleaned over the hand basin, but into a receptacle
for waste water.</p>

<p>Clean teeth will not decay. If the first teeth are
allowed to decay, the second will not be sound. The
rudiments of both sets of teeth are formed in the jaw
before birth. The first teeth (20) are cut by thirty
months; the first permanent teeth are the six-year
molars; the second set are cut from six to twelve years
of age. The enamel of the teeth is formed once for all
during childhood. The substance of the teeth is
mineral, chiefly lime. It will therefore be appreciated
that the child needs abundance of mineral in order that
he may have sound tooth material. This he can get
only from mineral in his food (see page <a href="#Page_169">169</a>), or, before
his birth, from his mother’s diet. Good circulation in
the jaws is also essential for normal development both
for teeth and jaws, therefore the importance of some
hard food every day after ten months.</p>

<p>The toothbrush should be selected with care. A good
toothbrush is made with separate tufts, and with holes
along the back, that it may more easily be kept clean.
For children under three years it should be soft, for
older children medium. The care of the brush is as important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
as its use. An unclean toothbrush may be a
source of infection. It may be kept antiseptic by
being very thoroughly rinsed, preferably under running
water, then in borax water, or grain alcohol, and
placed across hooks or a glass, bristle face down, to
dry, after each using. Once or twice a week it
should be thoroughly disinfected by drying in the sun,
boiling in borax solution, or soaking in alcohol. It
should receive thorough disinfection after each using,
in case of influenza, tuberculosis, diphtheria, or other
infectious disease.</p>

<p><em>Dental Examination.</em> After one year of age the
child should have a dental examination and tartar
removed every six months. Any cavities should be
filled, and irregular teeth straightened. A decaying
tooth is a breeding place of germs which are carried,
with the poisons they produce, to the stomach and
thence through the system. Its sensitiveness compels
the child to do his chewing entirely on the other side,
spoiling the symmetry of the jaws, or to omit proper
chewing. It causes pain that lowers the tone of the
whole nervous system, produces irritable temper, and
interferes with mental work.</p>

<p>At the slightest complaint of discomfort or the merest
suspicion of decay, the child should go to the dentist for
attention. Prevention saves both pain and expense.
The dentist’s office should be a place of comfort, not
of torture by reason of neglect and decay.</p>

<p><b>The Eyes.</b> The eyes of mankind were called upon
chiefly for long-distance seeing, observation of operations
with coarse materials, and slow adjustment, until
the past few hundred years of civilization with its printing,
sewing, and other fine close work. The anatomy of
the eye has not yet become adapted to these new demands.</p>

<p>The child’s eye is not fully developed. The shape
of the eyeball is undergoing change during the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
twenty years. Farsightedness is normal until from
nine to twelve years of age.</p>

<p>Eyestrain will result, therefore, if the eyes are called
upon for fine, close work during the first ten years.
There is also a hereditary form of nearsight that can
be detected as early as six years by the oculist, and that
demands special care. Astigmatism (a structural defect
causing blurred vision) is a prevalent cause of eyestrain.
Squint and cross-eye, which are due to structural defect,
require treatment in early childhood or babyhood
to prevent the necessity of an operation, or possible
blindness.</p>

<p>Even normal eyes will suffer if their use is abused.
The following precautions should be observed with
little children and taught to school children, as practices
to be avoided for the sake of strong eyes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rubbing the eyes</p>

<p>Staring at a strong light</p>

<p>Watching a flickering light (as in moving pictures)</p>

<p>Sudden flash of strong light</p>

<p>Looking at pictures, reading, writing, drawing, or
doing handwork, in poor light</p>

<p>Use of artificial light, for children under seven or
eight years of age, for drawing, painting, reading, looking
at pictures, or other fine work</p>

<p>Long application to close work at any age</p>

<p>Use of eyes for reading, pictures, or other fine work
before breakfast</p>
</div>

<p>The child can be taught from babyhood to sit so that
the light falls from the left upon his pictures or drawing,
and not to sit either directly facing the window
or with his back squarely against it.</p>

<p>Reading for five minutes requires more than a thousand
separate movements of the eye,—as much work
as is required of it in an hour of ordinary use; and the
ciliary muscle, which controls the eye accommodation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
probably is required in that five minutes to do as much
work as in a day of ordinary seeing.</p>

<p>This has an important bearing upon the question
of how early a child should begin reading, writing,
sewing, or fine handwork; certainly, from the standpoint
of hygiene, such work should be deferred until
at least seven or eight years, and then begun only with
the assurance of the oculist that the eyes can stand the
strain.</p>

<p>School children should be taught to read with the best
conditions, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Light from the left</p>

<p>Strong steady light</p>

<p>Light placed so it does not shine directly into the eyes
and face</p>

<p>Not using the eyes before breakfast, as adjustment is
slower and more difficult on first rising</p>

<p>Not reading on trains or other vehicles</p>

<p>Resting the eyes every fifteen or twenty minutes by
looking up from the book at some distant object</p>
</div>

<p>Lamplight is easiest. Lights should always have a
plain shade. Indirect lighting is best. Gaslight should
have a Welsbach to give steady rays. White light is
hard on the eyes; amber light, produced by amber
shades, is easiest.</p>

<p>In selecting books for children, look for the following
requirements:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Paper white or cream, without gloss</p>

<p>Lines short, preferably three inches</p>

<p>Margins wide</p>

<p>Print large</p>

<p>Wide spacing between lines</p>
</div>

<p>Certain contagious diseases of the eyes temporarily
or permanently impair vision. At any sudden redness
or white discharge, the child should be immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
taken to the physician, as blindness may follow in a
few hours after infection, although it is preventable by
a simple immediate treatment. Children should be
warned never to use public towels or wash basins, or
to touch the eyes with soiled handkerchief or dirty
hands.</p>

<p>The eyes should be washed daily with the boric acid
solution until three or four years of age, and after that
with the plain or slightly salt water, using the boric
acid whenever irritation or redness appears.</p>

<p><b>Motor Training and Poise.</b> Provide some play
apparatus that requires motor coördination.</p>

<p>12 months to 3 years. A stile, of one or two low
steps, adjusted to the baby’s size, with handrail each
side, on which he can climb up and down. Tenpins,
large size ringtoss.</p>

<p>Use a small enamel cup for drinking, and let the
child, when feeding, use his spoon and cup himself as
early as he shows an inclination, which should be not
later than a year and a half. Do not scold when he
spills things while learning. By three years he should
have control, and be held to strict carefulness and neatness
in eating.</p>

<p>3 to 6 years. Jumping place, with elevation 1 to 2
feet from which to jump toward a marked space.
Teach the child how to jump correctly, landing on the
soles of the feet and bending the knees as he lands.</p>

<p>Car rail or substitute to walk along, preferably
raised 1 to 6 inches from the ground. A single painted
board 4 inches wide, or a painted mark 2 inches wide
will answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ringtoss more difficult</p>

<p>Throwing at a mark on the ground, floor, or wall</p>

<p>The fence for walking sidewise or for swinging from,
as used by Montessori</p>

<p>Swinging rings and a horizontal bar</p>

<p>Marching, skipping, folk-dancing</p>
</div>

<p>From three years, let him carry his tray at meal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
time, with dishes and food.</p>

<p>Teach the child how to gain poise when he begins to
feel worried, cross, nervous, excited:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a. Relaxing completely, sitting down if necessary</p>

<p>b. Taking long, slow, deep breaths</p>

<p>c. Sitting quietly for a few minutes to think,—with
eyes shut, if thinking is thereby easier</p>

<p>d. Thinking of something funny</p>

<p>e. Getting away by himself, in a room, or out with
nature</p>
</div>

<p><b>Posture.</b> Find out what is good posture in sitting,
standing, and walking, and see that the child maintains
these. During childhood and youth the bones
are still soft and yielding, readily altered in shape.</p>

<p>Stretching, throwing, swinging from rings or horizontal
bars, climbing, rowing, swimming, are excellent
preventive exercises, and useful for correction of curvatures
or round shoulders. For the child’s use select
chairs that are properly constructed (as most chairs are
not) and a table at which he can work without stooping,
changing such furniture to meet his needs as he grows.</p>

<p>Spinal curvature and round shoulders may be caused
by rickets, eyestrain, partial deafness, improperly constructed
chairs and tables, long sitting, insufficient
outdoor life and physical activity, unequal strength of
complementary muscles of back and chest, or of right
and left sides, and by carrying always on one side.</p>

<p>Spinal curvature crowds the internal organs, interfering
with the normal functioning of lungs, heart,
blood supply, stomach, and intestines; it causes pressure
upon the spinal nerves, and consequent disorders
in remote parts of the body controlled by the affected
nerves.</p>

<p>If curvature has developed, special gymnastics and
training should be faithfully practiced in addition to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
removing the cause. Braces are inadvisable, preventing
needed exercise. The correction of even the slightest
curvature is important while the bones are still
plastic. The special exercises should be prescribed by
a physical director or physician.</p>

<p><b>Physical Exercises.</b> A child who has ample outdoor
play space, and clothes adapted to outdoor play
is not likely to need any special exercises. For correcting
abnormal or weak conditions, the following are
effective:</p>

<p>1. Hanging from bar or swinging rings. (Figure 3.)</p>

<p>To overcome tendency toward spinal curvature, and
to strengthen back and trunk muscles.</p>

<p>2. Lying on table, hard bed, or floor (covered by
clean sheet or blanket); lift knees to chest, alternate
legs four counts, then together four counts. (Figure 1.)</p>

<p>3. Same exercise in standing position.</p>

<p>4. Lying on hard, clean surface, lifting feet at right
angles to trunk; alternate legs four counts; together
four counts. (Figure 2.)</p>

<p>Exercises 2, 3, and 4 are valuable in overcoming
constipation, promoting digestion, strengthening trunk
muscles, increasing circulation to trunk and pelvis.</p>

<p>5. Lying on hard surface, arms folded, feet held
down, rise to sitting position. Four counts. (Figure 4.)</p>

<p>6. Same position, but hands clasped back of head.
Four counts.</p>

<p>7. Same position, but arms extended above head.
Four counts. (Figure 5.)</p>

<p>Exercises 5, 6, and 7 strengthen trunk, chest, and
back muscles and have also the values of 2, 3,
and 4.</p>

<p>All exercise should begin slowly and be done steadily.
Especially with trunk exercises there should be no
sudden, jerking movements. One who is unaccustomed
to these exercises should begin with the easiest, (2)
and (5), and gradually begin the more severe ones.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_144_fp" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<p class="center no-indent">Exercises for Trunk, Chest, and Back.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>These exercises are especially important for girls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
who are likely to miss the climbing and tumbling exercises
that their brothers enjoy. Girls especially need
the straight spine, the strong trunk muscles, and the
thorough pelvic circulation.</p>

<p>8. Lying on a hard surface, knees bent, forcibly
contract and expand the abdominal wall. By placing
the hand on the abdomen, the sinking and rising of the
abdominal wall is easily marked.</p>

<p>This is a very mild exercise for increasing circulation
in the trunk and pelvis, thereby promoting digestion,
overcoming constipation, and strengthening the pelvic
organs.</p>

<p><b>Preventing or Overcoming Nervousness.</b> Nervousness
may express itself as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Irritability, peevishness</p>

<p>Temper, tantrums, lack of emotional control</p>

<p>Poor coördinations, dropping things, shuffling in
walking, waddling gait, inability to hit a mark or walk
on a straight line.</p>

<p>Lack of motor control; involuntary jerkings of muscles,
twitchings (chorea or St. Vitus’ dance)</p>

<p>Restless sleep, disturbed sleep, nightmares, sleeplessness</p>

<p>Masturbation</p>

<p>Bed-wetting, weakness of kidneys</p>

<p>Nail-biting</p>

<p>Fears</p>

<p>Silliness, simpering</p>

<p>Inability to learn</p>

<p>Inability to carry out a plan; much dreaming that
never attains to expression in action</p>
</div>

<p>Marked nervous defects, such as imbecility, idiocy,
epilepsy, manias, cannot be more than mentioned here.
They may be present from birth, or may develop later.
Their treatment belongs entirely to the field of the
physician, neurologist, and psychopathologist. Treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of mental defects should begin at the earliest
possible age; some forms are curable if treated early.</p>

<p>Nervousness may be due to physical or psychological
conditions. It may appear at any age. Its causes
may be immediate or may lie farther back in childhood,
infancy, or heredity. As the nervous system was the
latest to evolve, it is therefore the least stable, and the
most likely to suffer under stress of conditions. If there
is a heredity in either branch of the family, either of
marked nervous defect, alcoholism, or neurasthenia,
special precautions should from the first be taken to
overcome this predisposition in the child.</p>

<p>Other causes of nervousness in children include:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Irregularity of régime</p>

<p>Poor nutrition</p>

<p>Constipation</p>

<p>Insufficient sleep, fatigue</p>

<p>Indoor life</p>

<p>Decaying teeth</p>

<p>Adenoids or enlarged tonsils</p>

<p>Eyestrain</p>

<p>Fine handwork, or reading; or other abuse of eyes</p>

<p>Pressure of school work</p>

<p>Undue excitement such as crowds, parties, theaters</p>

<p>Tickling, teasing, nagging, tossing</p>

<p>Masturbation</p>

<p>Suppression of curiosity regarding sex phenomena</p>

<p>Suppressing expression of interests, curiosity, or
emotion</p>

<p>Worry or unhappiness</p>

<p>Threats of fearsome punishment</p>

<p>Cultivating of fear by “scaring”, telling of grewsome
or unhappy stories, seeing exciting picture plays</p>

<p>Lack of training in self-control</p>
</div>

<p>Preventing nervousness is a matter of preventing
these causes; overcoming is a matter of removing the
cause and conducting a constructive program of physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
régime and psychological treatment. The physical
régime will include regularity, free outdoor life
and play, open-air sleeping, frequent rest periods,
nutritious diet, with special attention to sufficiency of
mineral and laxative foods, and use of relaxing or energizing
exercises.</p>

<p>Rhythm through instrumental music that is listened
to, or in dancing, marching, gymnastic exercises, and
singing, is of great value in overcoming nervousness.
Cheerful, happy, comfortable stories and pictures will
supply mental images to replace the disturbing ones,
especially before bedtime.</p>

<p>Relief from intestinal worms and local irritation, or
circumcision, may remove the cause of masturbation.
The child’s questions regarding sex phenomena should
always be answered wholesomely, reverently, sufficiently
to give him a true perspective and to satisfy his
natural curiosity.</p>

<p>The substitution of large muscle work, as with large
blocks, balls, carpenter tools, will provide activity
without taxing nerve ends of fingers. Examination by
the oculist (not optician) will locate eyestrain. Opportunity
for expression of wholesome emotions and
interests will remove tension and sense of suppression.</p>

<p>Interests or emotions that appear unwholesome or
abnormal should be patiently and thoroughly analyzed
to discover the germ of good that is in them, and to
utilize this; consultation with a physician, teacher,
minister, social worker, or psychologist, may be enlightening.
Wholesome emotions and interests should
have encouragement for full expression, limited by the
strength of the child and courtesy due to others.</p>

<p>Detect fatigue symptoms: (a) the tenseness shown by
flushed face, rapid, labored breathing, excitement, erratic
movements; or (b) relaxation shown by listlessness,
indifference, irritability, forgetfulness. Fatigue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
not only overstrains the nerves; it develops poisons
in the blood that affect the whole system.</p>

<p>Fears are a difficult problem. Make a list of the
things it is observed the child fears, such as the dark,
cats, dogs, flies, etc. Gradually, slowly, patiently
lead him to acquaintance with these, and therefore to
his own destruction of the fear. Teach him to
memorize quotations that ring with confidence, faith,
courage.</p>

<p>Cultivate self-control through regularity of regimen,
the example of poise, the denying of any object that is
screamed for, or cried for, the inculcating of an ideal
of self-control through story-telling.</p>

<p><b>Sex Hygiene.</b> This is both a physiological and a
psychological problem. Both phases must always be
recognized.</p>

<p><em>Physiological Hygiene.</em> In infancy, keep the special
organs clean as directed in Chapter VI. Consult a
physician regarding the advisability of circumcision;
this is needed in about twenty per cent. of boys, and
is often advisable in others; it is sometimes required
in girls.</p>

<p>Take special care that clothing is not rough, tight, or
irritating about the genitals; therefore avoid (a)
underdrawers with more than one-quarter wool;
some children with sensitive skin should have even
these lined with thin cotton gauze; (b) drawers cut too
short or shallow in the seat (a defect in some ready-made
styles); (c) trousers too short or tight or with
rough seams; (d) suspenders too short, that pull the
trousers too tight; trousers during first six years should
not have opening in front.</p>

<p>With young children, watch for any local irritation
or discharge. For the former, use local applications
of boric solution as a wash, followed by a starch powder
or zinc ointment. Discover the cause; it may be
rough or damp clothing, intestinal worms, acid urine due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
to excess of sugar or meat in the diet, or to insufficient
drinking water. Alkaline diet, or a pinch of soda in
the drinking water for a few days, will help to counteract
the acidity. As the child grows older, beyond six
years, encourage him to report to you any irritation,
and teach him how he should relieve it.</p>

<p>If a discharge appears, of mucous, whitish, or greenish
matter, report the matter immediately to the physician,
and take every precaution against infection; use a
local wash of boric acid, double strength, cleanse the
hands with antiseptic solution, sterilize the child’s
wash cloths, towels, underdrawers, and bedding, and
let him have his separate wash basin, chamber, and
bath until the physician gives assurance of no contagious
disease.</p>

<p>Teach the child to always wash the hands after going
to the toilet. See that the hands are outside the
bed covers at night; they may be folded under the cheek,
or the child may have a doll or toy animal to hold. Be
watchful, but do not let the child ever surmise that you
mistrust, suspect, or even watch him in these matters.</p>

<p>Avoid soft beds and especially feather beds, which are
enervating and are overheating to the spinal nerves.</p>

<p>Teach children never to use a public drinking cup or
towel; and never to sit on a public toilet, even in public
school, without first laying a paper over it so they do
not come directly in contact with the seat.</p>

<p>Avoid stimulating foods, such as condiments, or an
excess of meat—more than 2 or 3 ounces a day.</p>

<p>Avoid excitement by late hours, especially late
dancing parties, during adolescence. Set a standard
of ten o’clock closing for school or home dances for
these young people. Teach them to find recreation
not dissipation.</p>

<p><em>Psychological.</em> Cultivate respect for the body and
reverence for its creative work and organs, for motherhood,
fatherhood, and birth of any creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>Cultivate a sense of modesty in both girls and boys
from babyhood.</p>

<p>Inculcate in boys a spirit of chivalry toward all girls
and women; in girls, a sense of reserve, and an appreciation
of their responsibility for the social and moral
standards of boys.</p>

<p>Instill a personal ideal of worthy fatherhood and
motherhood; this may begin incidentally at two or
three years of age.</p>

<p>Give instruction in the biology of reproduction in
plants, emphasizing the protection, care, and forethought
for the young. The child naturally sees all
the phenomena of life in an impersonal and wholesome,
that is, a scientific way. Cultivate this attitude in
him and in yourself.</p>

<p>Before children begin going to school, see that they
are informed sufficiently about the origin and birth of
human life so that they will no longer be curious or interested
if unwholesome talk is presented. Ill-trained
children or unscrupulous adults usually sense a well-informed
and wholesome-minded child and are less likely
to present any vulgar conversation in his presence.</p>

<p>The boy will early meet with superstitions and perverted
ideals among his companions, particularly after
twelve years, when the influence of parents and teachers
is waning before that of his companions. Therefore
teach him before this age that he has a great trust,—to
protect these organs sacredly for his children until
he is grown and is wise enough to be a father; that
these organs are not like muscles which must be used
to develop and preserve their function, but that they
are glands, secreting fluids as other internal organs do,
like the spleen or the thyroid gland, and that these
fluids are needed for the well-being of the whole body;
that the boys who ignorantly think otherwise or act
otherwise are greatly injuring and weakening themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Prepare both boy and girl, by instruction at about
eleven years of age, for the physical changes that are
before them, so they will not be surprised or frightened
when these changes come. Thus prepared, they will
not ignorantly resort to measures that may produce
lifelong illness, or fall into the net of quacks, evil-minded
men or women, or ignorant companions.</p>

<p>Avoid taking the children to the theater before
twelve or fourteen years of age, and make it an event
worth while. Be sure beforehand that the play is
clean and wholesome and not overstimulating. Never
allow children to go to theaters or picture plays without
a responsible older person. Be your children’s
companion in drama and in fiction as long as possible,—as
long as you can see with their eyes and their
interests.</p>

<p>Keep children occupied with handwork, physical
activity, and outdoor life. It is the child with nothing
to do, living an overfed, indoor, uncontrolled life,
who has every condition for falling into temptation.</p>

<p>Cultivate an appreciation and taste for good literature,
poetry, sculpture, painting, music. Provide
abundance of good and wholesome books.</p>

<p>Teach children from babyhood that to follow merely
the instincts and the line of least resistance, to act
merely from impulse and emotion, is unworthy of a
human being.</p>

<p>Foster idealism and religion, which have always been
the great bulwarks of the soul and the refiners of instincts.</p>

<p><b>City or Country Life.</b> That the country provides
more natural physical conditions and health opportunities
is self-evident. The open air, the larger space
and facilities for muscular exercise, the freedom from
artificial excitement, are all essential to vitality. The
marked differences between city and country children
in height, weight, chest girth, strength of grip, vitality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
endurance, are attested by the statistics of special investigators
as well as by general observation. The
chest girth of country girls more nearly approaches
the average for boys of the same age than does that
of city girls. It is true that in sanitation the rural
districts and small towns have not kept pace with the
large cities. Ventilation, drainage, water supply, disposal
of sewage, clean milk, the reporting and control
of infectious diseases, are too often neglected in rural
districts. The improvement of these sanitary conditions
is part of the responsibility of the home-maker.</p>

<p><b>The School and Physical Health.</b> The weight of
medical, biological, and psychological authority of
such experts as G. Stanley Hall, John Dewey, Arthur
Holmes, Lightner Witmer, Thomas D. Wood, J. M.
Tyler, is decidedly against prevailing unhygienic
practices of the schools, such as home study for children
under high school age; nerve-racking academic
examinations; fine work in reading and writing for
children under nine years of age; indoor school life
for young children; artificial, sedentary life instead of
physical activity during school age; the over emphasis
of the mental and the neglect of the motor activities.</p>

<p>In a recent volume, “The Health of the Child,”
Lewis M. Terman writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The close correlation of morbidity with years of school
attendance and with the progress of the school term;
the deterioration of attention toward the end of the
school year; the damaging effects of strenuous school
activities upon appetite, digestion, metabolism and the
constitution of the blood; the ill-effects from deprivation
of fresh air and healthful exercise; the impairment
of nervous coördinations and the profound disturbances
reflexly produced by worry—these and other injurious
effects have been sufficiently attested to justify the most
vigorous prosecution of reform in matters of educational
hygiene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“We have taken the child out of its natural habitat
of open air, freedom, and sunshine, and for nearly half
his waking hours we are subjecting him to an unnatural
régime, one which disturbs all the vital functions of
secretion, excretion, circulation, respiration, and nutrition.”</p>

<p>These defects are often acquired before school age,
or as a result of home conditions during school age.
Note that they are chiefly preventable by good hygiene
in the home, practiced by intelligent mothers and
fathers.</p>

<p>Forms of rheumatism, heart disease, infectious
diseases (such as whooping cough, measles, mumps,
scarlet fever), respiratory diseases (as pneumonia,
croup, tuberculosis), all are prevalent and preventable
diseases of childhood, reaping every year a great harvest,
and leaving a trail of permanent defects.</p>

<p>Two means of prevention are necessary and at hand:</p>

<p>(1) Wholesome daily hygiene (the elements of such
hygiene have been suggested in the foregoing pages).
(2) Early detection of defects or weakness, and their
remedy in the incipient stage. This is possible by
an examination every six months during childhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
and youth, by (a) a competent physician, trained for
preventive examinations, (b) osteopath, (c) dentist,
(d) oculist. With these two precautions on the part
of the home, the present enormous deathroll of one
hundred and fifty thousand little children each year
from <em>preventable</em> causes, and the preventable defective
conditions of fourteen million of the twenty million
school children, could be practically eliminated, and as
reckoned by Professor Irving Fisher, the span of life
for each child could be increased fifteen years.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors in the well-being
of any individual is right feeding in childhood, especially
in early childhood. One of the chief causes of
sickness and death among young children is their
wrong feeding. A conservative estimate would be two
thousand ill on any one day from this cause. Further,
wrong feeding weakens the system so the child is much
more susceptible to infectious diseases.</p>

<p>Not only the general health of the individual but
also the quality of the teeth, the efficiency of the digestive
system, the desire for stimulants, the stability of
the nervous system, the quality of mental activity,
power of will, strength of character, the happiness or
misery of everyday living, are profoundly affected by
the foods and régime of feeding during childhood.</p>

<p>The intelligence of the mother or the nurse, the
grandmother, the father, and the friend has far more
to do with the right feeding of children than does the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
amount of the family income. The child in the wealthy
home is quite as liable to be wrongly fed as the child
in the poor home. It is possible to buy enough of the
right kinds of nourishing foods for a very small sum.</p>

<p>To feed a child so as to produce one hundred per
cent. efficiency in his health to-day and fifty years from
to-day should be the ambition of every one who has
the care of that child,—not merely to keep him from
death or present illness. This is not an easy matter,
nor to be learned in a day or a month. It requires
careful and earnest study of food composition, food
values, the physiology of digestion, dietetics, cooking;
and then patience, thoroughness, and practicability
to put this knowledge into use three to five times a
day, seven days in the week, every week in the year.</p>


<p>The Fundamental Principles of Feeding</p>

<p><b>Cleanliness and Purity.</b> The following standards are
necessary to meet these requirements.</p>

<p>1. Unadulterated foods. Foods unwholesome because
of adulteration include:</p>

<p>a. Canned goods preserved with benzoate of soda
or other artificial preservative</p>

<p>b. Candies, jams, pickles, containing coal-tar dyes
and other adulterants</p>

<p>c. Sulphur-bleached dried fruits and molasses</p>

<p>d. Bakery goods made with preserved eggs, milk,
and other adulterants</p>

<p>2. Protection from dust, dirt, and insects. Dry
foods, such as bread, crackers, dates, figs should be
kept wrapped in moisture-proof paper. Butter, bakery
goods, and dried fruits not so wrapped should be kept
under glass. Fruits and vegetables should be kept
within doors, protected from dogs and cats. Milk,
which is most easily contaminated, should be produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
in a clean dairy, by clean workers, kept covered constantly,
protected from animals, in a cool place.</p>

<p>3. Preparation under sanitary conditions. Bakeries
and other food factories and kitchens should be scrupulously
clean, with abundance of fresh air and sunlight.
All persons handling food should be free from any
contagious disease, with clean hands and garments.
This factor is even more important than freedom from
adulteration.</p>

<p>It is easily possible to-day to ascertain what products
meet the pure food requirements. By careful purchasing,
and the preparation and serving of food at
home by healthy individuals, with intelligent attention
to sanitation, these essential requirements of hygiene
can be most completely assured.</p>

<p><b>Regularity.</b> Meals should be served promptly at
<em>regular</em> hours, and <em>no food taken between meals</em>. If
food is taken irregularly, rhythm is disturbed, the
digestive fluids are not ready and cannot act efficiently.
If food is taken while undigested food remains
in the stomach, the work of digestion must begin
over again, as the fluids secreted in the early stage of
digestion are different from those in the last stages.
Thus the food previously taken is kept in the stomach
too long; it ferments, too much acid is produced,
sour stomach results, the stomach is irritated, the
glands are overworked and become exhausted, and
the consequence is poor digestion. To do its best
work, the stomach requires rest between feedings.</p>

<p>During sleep, the activity of the digestive tract is
very slow. Solid food taken less than an hour or two
before bedtime is not well digested and is likely to
remain in the stomach and ferment; the pressure
produces disturbed sleep and “bad dreams”; the
stomach is not ready for digesting breakfast; the individual
wakens tired, without appetite, and possibly
with headache or nausea. Babies, having only milk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
can be fed at bedtime. With children two to six years,
an hour should intervene between the light supper and
sleep; with older children, from two to four hours.</p>

<p>If a child is regularly hungry between meals, the
cause may be (a) insufficient quantity at meals; (b)
diet not well balanced—frequently insufficient mineral
foods; (c) eating too rapidly so that food is not well
chewed and therefore not assimilated; (d) too long
intervals between meals. If occasionally hungry between
meals, light food requiring little digestion should
be given, such as fruit juice, ripe fruit, dates, figs, or a
glass of milk. Cake, cookies, candies, or other hearty
foods upset digestion.</p>

<p><b>Simplicity.</b> This applies both to the variety served
at one meal, to the method of preparation, and to the
serving. A maximum of five or six food items at one
meal is sufficient, and is more easily digested than a
greater number. Foods simply cooked require less
work of the digestive organs than do more complex
mixtures; at the same time they cultivate simple
tastes, with their contentment.</p>

<p><b>Cheerfulness.</b> Good cheer is the best of appetizers.
Professor Pawlow has discovered that the amount
and the efficiency of the gastric juice are affected by the
anticipation and enjoyment of food, and that the gastric
juice thus poured out at the beginning of a meal, which
he has called the “appetite juice”, is the most powerful
and active. Happiness and laughter (but not silliness
or horseplay) should therefore be encouraged at meals.</p>

<p>A child should not be fed when excited, angry, cross,
crying, unhappy, or overtired. Under emotional stress
no gastric or intestinal juices are formed, and food
cannot be digested. When a child is very tired, the
system is too exhausted to do the work of digestion,
and nitrogenous foods (such as meat or eggs)
taken then are positively harmful, as they only decay.
If at mealtime a child is cross simply because he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
hungry, feeding will help put him in a happy mood,
conducive to digestion. Otherwise, it is better to give
only a small quantity of easily digested food, such as
fruit juice, thin gruel, vegetable broth, toast, milk.</p>

<p><b>Sufficiency.</b> This applies to the total quantity of
energy and fuel foods, or what is technically called
caloric sufficiency; and to the quantity and proportions
of each of the food elements, technically called a
balanced ration. Careful studies of dietetic needs have
been made within the last ten years, and the approximate
needs and conditions for different ages are now
so well defined that adequate feeding need no longer
be mere guess-work.</p>

<p><b>Caloric Sufficiency.</b> A calorie is the measure of a
unit of heat as an inch is a measure of a unit of space.
One calorie<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of heat is the amount that will raise the
temperature of a pint of water 4° Fahrenheit. The
amount of a given food, as of bread, that would furnish
this much of heat when digested in the body is a
one-calorie portion of bread,—<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> ounce, or a half-inch
cube. The total caloric requirement depends
upon the amount of bodily heat and muscular energy
needed by an individual. This will depend upon
the individual’s (1) weight, (2) age, (3) occupation,
(4) health, (5) climate. The amount of outdoor
life, clothing, the temperament, height, and personal
idiosyncrasies will require individual variations from
the average.</p>


<h3>Daily Energy Requirements During Growth.</h3>

<p>Part of this energy is needed to carry on the vital
processes, such as circulation, secretion, digestion;
during the waking hours, energy is needed for every
muscular action, such as walking, dressing, talking,
exercising.</p>

<p><b>Proportions of Food Elements.</b> To furnish what is
termed a “balanced ration”, the protein, carbohydrate,
and fat should each constitute, in the total
calories for the day, approximately the following proportions:
protein 10 to 15 per cent., carbohydrate 50
to 60 per cent., fat 25 to 35 per cent. To some extent
the fat and carbohydrate are interchangeable, but a
great excess of fat or carbohydrate produces indigestion,
and great insufficiency of fat starves the nerves.
Each gram (about <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>28</sub></span> ounce) of protein or carbohydrate
furnishes four calories of heat; each gram of fat furnishes
nine calories. Without sufficient protein, the
child will not increase in growth. An excess of protein
is no less injurious, as it cannot be stored in the
body, but must be eliminated. Especially injurious is
an excess of proteins containing purin-bodies, which
produce urea and uric acid, thereby causing forms of
kidney disease, gout, and rheumatisms. Excess of
food, combined with sluggish elimination, produces
putrefaction and fermentation in the intestine, resulting
in auto-intoxication from the poisonous gases and
chemicals, thereby inducing irritability, nervousness,
languor, low resistance to germ diseases, colds.</p>

<p>In childhood and maternity a purin-free diet and
one least likely to produce auto-intoxication is especially
important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>A sufficient proportion of minerals is no less essential
to life and health, although these are needed in minute
quantities. Research in physiological chemistry has
only recently discovered the vital significance of
minerals. The quantities needed in childhood are
not yet exactly known. Not only the bones and teeth
but each cell and fluid requires mineral matter. The
digestion and assimilation of food, the absorption of
oxygen and the elimination of carbonic acid gas by the
blood, the normal action of the heart, the generation of
energy, the sensitiveness and reaction of the nerves,
are all dependent upon the mineral supply in the system.
There are no less than twelve, the principal ones being
calcium, phosphorus, iron, soda, potash, sulphur. Calcium
(lime) is especially needed for bones and teeth,
phosphorus for growth and for nerve cells, iron for
red blood corpuscles, soda for elimination of carbonic
acid gas. The daily requirements for a man are:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Lime .7 gram; Phosphorus 2.75 grams; Iron .015 gram.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The allowance for a child should probably approximate
this, and growing children probably need more of lime
and phosphorus.</p>

<p>Minerals supplied to the body in vegetable and
animal tissues or fluids have in some way been vitalized
and made organic, so they are readily assimilated by
the system. Mineral matter as dug from the earth
and purchased at the drugstore is inorganic and is
not assimilated either so thoroughly or readily.</p>

<p>Vitamines are equally essential in the food. These
are subtle organic substances, as yet little understood,
but necessary for perfect assimilation. Cooking, especially
at a high temperature or for a long period, usually
diminishes the vitamines in foods. This is one special
objection to boiled, condensed, and powdered milk,
patent baby foods, canned vegetables, canned, dried
and salted meats. Children kept exclusively on such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
foods and boiled water do not thrive. Such a diet
produces scurvy. Some fresh, uncooked food, such as
raw milk, uncooked fruit or fruit juices, uncooked vegetables,
is needed every day.</p>

<p>Laxative elements are also essential. These are (a)
cellulose, found in the husk of whole wheat, and the
fibers of vegetables and fruits; (b) water, found in
milk, vegetables, and fresh or stewed fruits; (c) oil,
found in cream, olive oil, and fatty nuts; (d) sugars,
found in honey, molasses, dried fruits; (e) vegetable
acids, found in fruits.</p>

<p>Hard foods, requiring work of the jaws, are needed
every day, especially from nine months to seven years
of age, while the first and second teeth are coming.
Hard foods exercise and develop the jaws and teeth,
and promote a good circulation through the jaws,
mouth, and nose. They may be supplied by a chicken
or chop bone wiped free of the cooked meat, or after
nine months by hard crust, hard toast, zwieback, or
educator crackers, given at one or two meals every
day. Soft, mushy foods as a steady diet are injurious,
not only because they fail to supply the needed exercise
and circulation, but also because they cling to the
teeth, and by fermenting produce their early decay.</p>

<p>Foods containing growth-producing principles are
needed daily. Little is yet known of this factor.
Some foods that, according to their chemical composition,
would be considered valuable for growth, have
been found on experimentation to be lacking in growth-producing
properties; among these are corn, bacon,
gelatine. Other foods have marked growth-producing
results, and among these are milk, butter, eggs, whole
wheat.</p>

<p><b>Foods Permissible for Children at Different Ages.</b>
Add each new food gradually, beginning with a mere
taste and observing whether it agrees. Eggs, especially
white, should be added cautiously, and discontinued if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
they cause swelling, indigestion, or diarrhea. Raw
fruits must be selected with great care, neither overripe
nor underripe, nor swallowed in lumps; they are
prohibited in diarrhea.</p>

<p><b>Foods Injurious to Children.</b> Never to be given
under twelve years of age; not advised for any age.</p>

<p>Stimulants: Coffee, tea, beer, wine. These furnish
no food value but stimulate the heart and leave
serious poisons that injure kidneys, liver, stomach,
and nerves.</p>

<p>Condiments: Pepper, mustard, catsup, vinegar,
pickles, horseradish. These are irritating to the delicate
lining of the stomach; they overstimulate the
appetite; they have no food value. Excess of acids
extracts needed mineral from the body.</p>

<p>Meats: Pork roast or chops, ham, sausages, canned
or dried meats and fish, corned beef, sweetbreads, kidneys,
game. All are difficult of digestion.</p>

<p>Pastry: Pie, tarts, dumplings, cream puffs. The
combination of fat and starch makes these difficult
of digestion.</p>

<p>Rich Foods: Rich cake, puddings, sauces, preserves,

foods.</p>

<p>Fried Foods: Fried meat, potatoes, eggs; fritters,
doughnuts, waffles, pancakes, French toast. Fat so
combined with starch or protein delays, even prevents,
digestion. Starch requires longer cooking than is
possible in frying.</p>

<p>Fresh Baked (less than twenty-four hours old):
Bread, rolls, muffins, cake. Rolls or muffins may be
served warm by re-heating in oven. Fresh bread or
cake forms a sticky mass, very difficult for the digestive
juices to dissolve or penetrate.</p>

<p><b>Illnesses Produced by Wrong Feeding.</b> Illness may
be due to one of several causes. Wrong feeding is
one fundamental cause of ill health and a direct cause
of many forms of illness. An excess or deficiency of
any one of the food elements, wrong combinations
of foods, wrong habits of feeding, lack of cleanliness
or purity, improper cooking, may all produce
illness.</p>

<p>The general ill health and low vitality from wrong
feeding may be due to:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">(a) Auto-intoxication, from putrefaction of food in
the intestine because of constipation, or from
excess of purins;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">(b) Excess of acid in the blood, due to excess of acid-forming
foods or deficiency of alkali-forming
foods;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">(c) Malnutrition or anemia, due to insufficient food,
or to lack of some food element; frequently
due to lack of fats or minerals.</p>

<p><b>Digestion.</b> In the process of digestion, foods are not
broken down into simple chemical elements, as nitrogen,
hydrogen, oxygen, but into simpler yet still very
complex compounds, as organic minerals (lime, phosphorus,
soda), simpler sugars, fatty acids, emulsions,
soaps; and the proteins into their many forms of amino-acids
and (if these are inherent) purins and uric acid.
Soluble minerals, simple sugars, and many drugs are
quickly absorbed from the stomach directly into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
circulation. Water passes into the small intestine in
five to twenty minutes. The solid portions of mother’s
milk complete their stomach digestion in about two
hours, cow’s milk and other easily digested foods in
two and a half to three hours, under favorable conditions.
Digestion is continued in the small intestine,
where about four hours are required for further digestion;
the soluble portion is absorbed into the circulation,
and the indigestible remainder, with waste cell material
and bile, passes into the large intestine. There the
journey is very irregular and slow, requiring from ten
to twenty hours. The longer the delay, the greater the
fermentation and putrefaction, and the accumulation of
putrefactive bacteria and poisonous gases; the poisons,
which are constantly being absorbed into the system,
produce auto-intoxication. About half the solid waste
is bacteria and waste cell tissue.</p>

<p><b>Food Composition.</b> Every one who is responsible
for the feeding of children should be thoroughly acquainted
with the different food substances and the
composition and value of common foods. For practical
purposes of dietetics, foods are analyzed into their
content of protein, carbohydrate, fat, mineral, cellulose,
water. Some foods contain only one or two of
these elements; other foods contain them all.</p>

<p>1. Protein foods are those that contain nitrogen;
their special use is to build new body cells (for growth)
and to replace waste of tissue; they also furnish energy.
Proteins differ in value according to the number and
the kinds of amino-acids in their composition.</p>

<p>Foods containing high percentage of protein:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Eggs<br>
Milk<br>
Cheese<br>
Cereals<br>
Almonds<br>
Peanuts<br>
Peas<br>
Beans<br>
Lentils<br>
Fish<br>
Lean meat<br>
</p>

<p>2. Carbohydrates (sugars and starches) furnish bodily
heat and muscular energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Foods containing high percentage of starch:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Potatoes<br>
Rice<br>
Cereals<br>
Tapioca<br>
Macaroni<br>
Farina<br>
</p>

<p>Foods containing high percentage of sugar:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Sweet fruits<br>
Dried fruits<br>
Beets<br>
Carrots<br>
Honey<br>
Maple Syrup<br>
Molasses<br>
Barley sugar<br>
Cane sugar<br>
</p>

<p>Starch digestion begins in the mouth by the action
of the saliva and is completed in the intestines.
Starches are changed to a form of sugar. Excess of
carbohydrates is stored in the liver or as fat through
the body.</p>

<p>3. Fats furnish energy and heat.</p>

<p>Foods containing high percentage of fat:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Cream<br>
Butter<br>
Egg yolk<br>
Olive oil<br>
Cottonseed oil<br>
Nuts (except chestnuts)<br>
Meat fats<br>
</p>

<p>4. Minerals are found in grains, in fruit, green vegetables,
milk, eggs, meat.</p>

<p>Calcium and phosphorus are furnished in high
percentage by:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Grape juice<br>
Orange juice<br>
Rhubarb<br>
Maple sap<br>
Milk<br>
</p>

<p>Calcium, phosphorus, and iron are all supplied in
high percentage in:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Spinach<br>
Celery<br>
Peas<br>
Lima beans<br>
String beans<br>
Apples<br>
Prunes<br>
Peaches<br>
Pears<br>
Dates, raisins<br>
Whole wheat<br>
Whole cereals<br>
Egg yolk<br>
Lean meat (except calcium)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>While milk contains only a low percentage of iron,
it furnishes a high proportion of the day’s supply in
children’s diet, because of the total quantity used.</p>

<p>Valuable mineral material in many fruits and vegetables
is just beneath the skin. It is dissolved into
the water if these foods are boiled. The mineral
matter is conserved by baking, or stewing, or steaming,
by cooking without paring, or by using the water in
which they are boiled.</p>

<p>The mineral matter is in the germ and the husks of
grains. Refined foods, such as white flour and sugar,
polished or puffed rice, processed barley and corn meal,
cream of wheat, cornstarch, sago, from which the husk
has been removed, have been robbed of their mineral
matter. The whole ground grains and brown sugar
retain the minerals.</p>

<p>5. Water, a necessary part of all tissues, constitutes
about sixty per cent. of the body weight. It promotes
circulation of the blood and other internal fluids, dissolves
poisons, aids elimination of waste through urine,
feces, and perspiration. Water is best taken half an
hour before meals, and at the close. If taken with the
meal, it should be only after food in the mouth has been
swallowed, that it may not interfere with the action of
the saliva upon the food. Ice in water makes it too cold
for the stomach, and unless artificial, is apt to contain
dangerous impurities. Water should be sipped, warmed
in the mouth before being swallowed, and not more than
one glass taken at a time. Water is supplied in:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Milk<br>
Cocoa<br>
Broths<br>
Fruit juices<br>
Fruits<br>
Green vegetables<br>
</p>

<p>Water constitutes about 65 per cent. of meats, 80 per
cent. of fish, 90 per cent. of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>6. Cellulose. The indigestible cellulose and fibers
in food furnish a bulk of waste which stimulates the
intestines to muscular action. Supplied in:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">
Whole wheat<br>
Whole cereals<br>
Prunes, dates<br>
Figs, raisins<br>
Fibrous vegetables as celery, spinach, onions, carrots, beets, peas, beans<br>
Skins of apples, pears<br>
</p>

<p>Cellulose is lacking in concentrated foods, as cheese,
nuts, sugar, butter; refined foods, as white flour,
cream of wheat, cornstarch; in liquid foods.</p>

<p>Laxative Foods:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Figs<br>
Dates<br>
Prunes<br>
Orange<br>
Apple<br>
Raisins<br>
Peach<br>
Plum<br>
Rhubarb<br>
Grapes<br>
Whole wheat cereals<br>
Whole wheat bread<br>
Whole wheat crackers<br>
Corn meal<br>
Bran muffins<br>
Peanut butter<br>
Pecan nuts<br>
Gingerbread<br>
Molasses<br>
Honey<br>
Onions<br>
Spinach<br>
Olive oil<br>
Cottonseed oil<br>
</p>

<p><b>Purin Bodies in Common Foods.</b> Purin bodies are
found in some protein foods. Purins are uric-acid
forming. The poisons of purins are believed to be
productive of gout, rheumatism, migraine and periodic
headaches, bilious attacks, catarrhs, neurasthenia, and
general ill-health of an indefinite nature.</p>

<p><b>Acid-forming and Alkali-forming Foods.</b> The blood
contains some acids and some alkalies. For physical
efficiency, the balance should be slightly alkaline. In
the process of digestion minerals are oxidized into
their chemical constituents of acids or alkalies. An
excess of acid interferes with the normal alkalinity of
the blood and secretions, prevents the normal absorption
of oxygen and elimination of carbonic acid gas
by the blood, hinders the work of the white blood corpuscles,
irritates the nerves, lowering, therefore, the
resistance and vitality, and irritates the kidneys. In
the dietary, care should be taken to include alkali as
Well as acid-forming foods.</p>

<p><b>The Question of Meat.</b> Some authorities on dietetics
now advise against giving meat in early childhood.
Wiley and Mendel advise waiting until about four
years, Sherman and Lorand until about eight.</p>

<p>The following objections are made to meat in children’s
diet:</p>

<p>(1) It has a high percentage of purin bodies, which
the child’s organism is less fitted to dispose of.</p>

<p>(2) It is acid-forming to a high degree.</p>

<p>(3) “Meat proteins are much more susceptible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
putrefaction in the intestine, giving rise to absorption
of putrefactive products which are more or less injurious
(producing ‘auto-intoxication’) than are the proteins
of most other foods.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>(4) It is stimulating to the flow of gastric juice, especially
the extractives, which are found particularly
in meat juices, meat broths, beef tea. As an acid-forming
food it is stimulating, and easily irritating, to
the nerves, and therefore is disadvantageous with
nervous children, or when the nervous system is yet
highly sensitive, as it is in early childhood.</p>

<p>(5) Carnivorous animals, such as the cat and the
dog, do not permit their young to have meat until the
teeth are developed. Meat given experimentally to
young kittens produced convulsions.</p>

<p>(6) It is an expensive form of protein. Beef juice
contains chiefly the stimulating extractives, and a
slight quantity of iron.</p>

<p>(7) Protein in milk, selected vegetables, and (usually)
eggs, is more easily digested; and iron can be supplied
by selected vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>The following table gives approximately the comparative
value of a 100-calorie portion of beef juice (requiring
3½ pounds of lean beef) and an equal bulk of milk.</p>

<p>The meat at twenty-two cents a pound costs seventy-seven
cents; the milk at ten cents a quart costs five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
cents. One pound of meat will give little more than
one fourth of this food value; one ordinary serving (2
ounces) only 3 per cent. of the above values.</p>

<p>Physicians, on the other hand, more often advise
meat, especially for the iron and the stimulation to
digestion.</p>

<p><b>The Question of Sugar.</b> Sugar is a concentrated
form of fuel food. Children need much of fuel foods,
but this can be given in the form of fats and starches as
well as sugar. Sweet easily spoils the appetite for
plain, more wholesome foods, and gives a sense of
sufficiency before the needs of the body have been
satisfied. Children whose taste has been spoiled by
sweetened food are more likely to show a distaste for
wholesome vegetables. Sugar taken between meals or
in excess at meals is irritating to the sensitive lining
of the stomach. Sugar excess causes fermentation in
the stomach and intestines, overtaxes the liver, reduces
the normal alkalinity of the blood, produces nausea,
headache, biliousness, irritability, nervousness. It injures
the teeth by causing mouth acidity, which produces
tooth decay, and by causing distaste for simple
lime-containing foods. The peevishness and irritability
of children after an overdose of candy is very likely
due to the indigestion and the hyperacidity of the
blood, which irritates the nerves.</p>

<p>Cane sugar and candy lack the mineral matter found
with sugar in the natural syrups, fruits, and vegetables.
The necessary amount (and it is small) of sugar should
therefore be given to young children in the form of
fruits, at the close of the midday meal. It is advantageous
to the child’s efficiency and contentment not to
have candy or ice cream under four years of age, and
he will thrive without them until ten years. When
allowed, they should be given only in slight amount
as a dessert at the close of dinner, and not between
meals.</p>

<p><b>Rational Dietary.</b> A rational dietary for children
should meet the following requirements:</p>

<p>1. Total calories per day, computed for the age,
weight (normal); modified by the activity, season,
health, of the individual child</p>

<p>2. Balance of protein, fat, carbohydrate: Protein
10-15 per cent; fat 25-35 per cent; carbohydrate 50-60
per cent.</p>

<p>3. Purin-free or low in purins</p>

<p>4. Minerals supplied, especially lime, phosphorus,
iron, soda, potash</p>

<p>5. Vitamines supplied by some uncooked or fresh,
slightly cooked foods</p>

<p>6. Laxatives furnished by cellulose, water, oils,
sugars, vegetable acids</p>

<p>7. Hard foods, requiring gnawing and chewing</p>

<p>8. No irritants or artificial stimulants, <em>e.g.</em> pepper,
mustard, vinegar, condiments, alcohol, beer, tea, coffee</p>

<p>9. Combination of food carefully arranged:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>a. Some alkali-forming</p>

<p>b. Milk not served with acids, as tomatoes, oranges, apples,
apricots, peaches, lemon juice</p>

<p>c. Agreeable proportion of liquids and solids</p>

<p>d. Flavors combined that taste well together</p>

<p>e. Variety slight at one meal (3 to 6 items); wider range from
day to day</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>10. Cooking:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>a. Albumen (milk, white of egg) slightly coagulated</p>

<p>b. Cereals and starches thoroughly cooked</p>

<p>c. Fats not overheated (below smoking or scorching point)</p>

<p>d. Fats not mixed while hot with starches or sugars (gravies,
sauces, fried foods, pastry), or with protein (fried eggs)</p>

<p>e. Vegetable cellulose removed, or divided, according to the
development of the digestive system of the child</p>

<p>Differences of social, economic, and climatic conditions
will naturally lead to differences of usual rising
hour and general day’s régime. The above schedule
is consistent with the environment represented in the
daily schedule on pages 124, 125.</p>

<p>A special schedule should be made out for the individual
child, according to his environment and special
needs. Certain fundamental principles must be followed,
in varying this schedule. (1) Regular times for
meals; (2) intervals between meals; (3) heaviest meal
at midday; (4) interval before bedtime; (5) interval
before bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>To make out a dietary for a given individual.</p>

<p>1. To compute the total calories required for one day,
(a) take the normal weight for the age, sex, height (see
appendix), and (b) multiply this by the calories required
per pound of body weight. (Table, page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>.)</p>

<p>Use the minimum calories for youngest, maximum for
oldest in each age group. A child of active temperament
requires more calories than a phlegmatic child of
same age and weight. Factors indicating a liberal allowance
of calories are outdoor life, cold weather, vigorous
exercise, or a child under normal weight. A
smaller allowance is indicated by indoor life, little activity,
hot weather, or a child over normal weight.</p>

<p>2. Compute the number of these total calories for
protein (15 per cent. of total calories), fat (25-35 per
cent.), carbohydrates (50-60 per cent.).</p>

<p>3. Make out a tentative day’s dietary, in 100-calorie
portions, and add or deduct portions until
the total of computed calories is approximated; a
difference not to exceed 10 per cent. is allowable.
(Table, page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>.)</p>

<p>4. Analyze these portions (see appendix), and compare
with computed amounts (2 above) for balance of
protein, fat, carbohydrate. Differences not to exceed
ten per cent. are allowable. For compound foods, as
custard, purée, analyze each of the ingredients.</p>

<p>5. Analyze for lime, phosphorus, iron.</p>

<p>6. Check for alkali-forming foods, vitamines, laxatives,
hard foods.</p>

<p>7. Divide into meals. The heaviest meal should
come in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>8. Note the method of preparation suited to the
development and condition of the individual.</p>

<p>The making of a well-balanced and organized dietary
for a day requires several hours of careful calculating.
It is therefore the part of wisdom, as well as economy of
energy, to carefully make out a dietary for six or seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
days, that there may be balance in each day’s ration,
and a wide range of variety from day to day; and to
preserve these for reference. By measuring out 100-calorie
portions of common foods for a few days, the student
comes to recognize these quickly, and the assembling of
a meal comes to have all the zest of a game.</p>

<p><b>Care of Food.</b> All food should be kept covered,
protected from dust, bacteria, insects, odors, poisonous
gases (from bad drainage in refrigerator or kitchen).
Butter should be kept in oiled paper or covered by
a salted muslin cloth.</p>

<p>Cooked foods should be quickly and thoroughly
cooled, and then covered and kept in a cool place.</p>

<p>Milk requires the most painstaking care, as bacteria
multiply in it very rapidly unless it is kept cool and
clean. It should be kept in a seamless, non-rusting
receptacle, covered from dust and insects (preferably
with a clean, double muslin cloth that will admit air
but keep out dust); and placed in a clean, odorless,
ventilated place. If a refrigerator or clean, cool
cellar, springhouse, or well is not available, a homemade
refrigerator may be constructed, similar to the fireless
cooker, that will require little ice. Or the bottle
may be placed in a basin of cool running water and
covered with a clean muslin cloth the edges of which
absorb the water; if thus placed in a draft, the evaporation
will keep the milk cool. In hot weather it should
be pasteurized for children under six years, and at
other seasons for children under four, unless certified.</p>

<p>Milk should preferably be bottled at the dairy for
delivery. If delivered from cans it should be exposed
as little as possible to the air and dust, the measures
should be scrupulously clean, and it should be poured
at once into bottles or jars that have been sterilized
by boiling and that are covered from dust until filled.
It should be immediately covered.</p>

<p>If milk is delivered in bottles, provision should be
made for protecting these from dust, sun, and animals
until they are brought into the kitchen. The bottles
should be well washed in cool water, especially around
the top and cover, before opening. The rim of the
bottle should be wiped with a clean cloth and the cover
replaced immediately after pouring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Milk which has been warmed or which has stood
uncovered outside the bottle should not be poured
back or used again for the children to drink, as bacteria
have multiplied in it very rapidly. It may be
used for cooking.</p>

<p><b>Milk.</b> The production of milk requires the greatest
cleanliness. If a cow is kept, the dairy, utensils,
methods of milking and caring for the new milk should
conform to the standards set forth in the Federal and
State Health Bulletins. If milk is purchased, inspection
should, if possible, be made of the dairy and the
methods of cooling and transportation. In the large
cities, milk is now graded according to the degree of
care and the cleanliness as indicated by the bacteria
count. Certified or Grade “A” should be used for
children under three years of age. Grade “A” is
preferable, but Grade “B” can be used for children
over two years. Grade “C” and loose milk are
fit only for cooking.</p>

<p>The milk from a herd is more uniform from day to
day than from a single cow. Holstein or Guernsey
milk is preferable for children, especially for infants, as
the lower fat content and softer curds make it more
easily digested than Jersey milk.</p>

<p>Sterilized or condensed milk is less easily digested and
less nutritious than raw milk, and is conducive to constipation.
The high degree of heat to which they have
been subjected has reduced the vitamines and affected
the protein.</p>

<p>Milk may spoil even before it has soured. Pasteurizing
delays souring but not spoiling. Unscrupulous
dealers sometimes add preservatives to prevent souring.
Such milk is dangerous. Clean, freshly soured milk
is harmless, but should not be given to children under
three except as buttermilk. With young children and
babies, buttermilk can sometimes be retained and digested
when sweet milk cannot be taken. The special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
tablets containing the Bulgarian bacillus should be used,
and usually, with the whole milk, in making buttermilk
for young children. These tablets may be obtained
from the druggist.</p>

<p>Skimmed milk has all the value of whole milk except
the cream. Whey contains the minerals, sugar
and fats. Bottled commercial cream has a very high
bacteria count and should never be used for children.
Ice cream should be freshly made of fresh, pasteurized
milk, with scrupulous cleanliness.</p>

<p><b>Principles of Cooking.</b> Before food can be utilized
by the body, it must be made soluble—changed into
substances that are dissolved so they can pass readily
through the walls of the food tube into the blood.
In the digestive tract fats, carbohydrates, and protein
must first be separated, as different digestive fluids
are provided to act upon each of these. Cooking for
children should (1) make foods easily soluble; (2) produce
little mixture of protein, carbohydrates and fats;
(3) improve the flavor, and (4) raise the temperature
to about blood heat (98° F.), when served.</p>

<p>The degree of development of the digestive fluids,
the stomach, and the teeth must be considered in
preparing food for an individual child. In infancy the
digestive system is undeveloped, lacking in digestive
fluids, stomach small, and there is no provision for
chewing.</p>

<p>Until nine months of age babies do not have digestive
fluids for starch, or for protein except the curds of
milk; their teeth are not yet serviceable for chewing,
and solid food of any kind is so indigestible that it often
causes convulsions, if given.</p>

<p>After nine months, starches thoroughly cooked and
without cellulose may be given cautiously.</p>

<p>All food must be easily soluble until two years of age,
that is, until enough of the first teeth have developed
for adequate chewing of soft cellulose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>For children under 18 months, cellulose and fibers
strained out of vegetables.</p>

<p>For children 18 months to 3 years (before first teeth
are all cut) vegetables mashed or chopped fine; coarse
cellulose removed.</p>

<p>At three years, all the first teeth (20) should be cut,
and the child can chew the cellulose of vegetables and
fruits.</p>

<p>For children three years (first teeth all cut) to 8
years (second teeth partially cut) vegetables diced,
whole cooked fruits.</p>

<p>During the first two years of second dentition (from
6 to 8 years) the missing teeth make chewing less
adequate, and care is needed to provide easily divided
food. After eight years enough of the permanent teeth
have been cut to permit fibers of meat in the diet.</p>

<p><b>Cooking for Children.</b> Before beginning the preparation
of food, wash the hands thoroughly and clean
the finger nails. See that all utensils are scrupulously
clean, as well as dish towels with which they are
wiped. Use agate or enamelware for all acid fruits
and vegetables, and a double boiler for milk. Do not
use aluminum ware for acids or eggs, or tin for acids,
as poisonous compounds would be formed. Taste food
before serving, using a clean spoon which is not replaced
in the food but immediately washed. Keep
food uncovered as little as possible.</p>

<p><em>Milk.</em> In heating milk always use a double boiler
and do not let the milk reach the boiling point. Boiling
hardens the protein and makes it difficult of digestion.</p>

<p>To pasteurize milk: put in sterilized bottles, stoppered
with non-absorbent cotton. Place bottles in kettle
with cold water coming to height of milk in bottles.
Put cloth or paper in bottom of kettle and between
bottles, to prevent breaking. Milk is advisably pasteurized
by bringing water to 145° F. and maintaining
at exactly this temperature for thirty minutes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
either turning fire low or removing kettle from fire,
leaving bottles in water for half an hour, or placing
the kettle in a fireless cooker, or covering tightly with
newspapers. Cool bottles quickly by placing in lukewarm
water, then in cold water, then on ice, or where
temperature of 45° can be maintained.</p>

<p><em>Toast.</em> Use stale bread. Make in the oven, drying
hard throughout, the outside then lightly browned in
gas oven or over coals or an electric toaster.</p>

<p><em>Dried fruits.</em> Sort carefully, remove blemishes,
wash thoroughly in colander. Soak overnight in
water to cover; bring to boil, and let <em>simmer</em> with
low fire or in fireless cooker until soft. Add no sugar
to prunes, dates, figs, seedless raisins, and little to
peaches, apples, apricots. California prunes should be
used, as they are sweeter and less acid. Honey may
be used, instead of sugar, for sweetening other fruits.
Soda should be added to tart fruits, as apricots.
For children one to three years, make pulp by removing
pits and mashing through fine colander (not tin).
For children over three, dates and figs may be served
uncooked, after thorough washing, or sterilizing for
ten minutes in a colander over steam and then drying.</p>

<p><em>Cereals.</em> Cereals require a high degree of heat for
the first five or ten minutes, to burst the covering of
the tiny starch cells, then long cooking at a moderate
temperature. This applies to oatmeal, barley, wheat
cereals, corn meal, samp, rice, tapioca, sago. A double
boiler should be used and, unless a coal fire is available
for a long period, a fireless cooker. The latter can be
made in a few hours at a cost of less than half a dollar,
by using a wooden box with a hinged cover, sawdust
for packing, and asbestos paper for lining.</p>

<p>In cooking any cereal, have the water boiling in
both the upper and lower parts of the double boiler.
Put the upper part directly over the heat and let the
water boil violently for a minute. Add salt in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
proportion of 1 tablespoon to one quart of water. Pour
in the cereal <em>very slowly</em>, so the boiling does not stop.
Let this boil five minutes, shaking gently, then place
in boiler and put into fireless cooker, or over low fire.</p>

<p>Gruel or porridge:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">1 part rolled or flaked oatmeal or wheat to 2 parts
water</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">1 part corn meal or rice to 3 parts water</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">1 part fine wheat or hominy, coarse oatmeal,
tapioca or barley to 4 parts water</p>
</div>

<p>Cereal jelly is made by straining the gruel through
cheesecloth or finest wire strainer.</p>

<p>Cereal water is made by using a smaller proportion
of cereal—from 1 to 2 tablespoons to 1 pint of water,—and
straining. It may be made from the prepared
barley, wheat, oat, or rice flour, using 1 tablespoon of
the flour, blended with 2 tablespoons cold water, and
proceeding then as with the whole cereal, stirring occasionally,
and cooking from thirty to sixty minutes.</p>

<p>Note that cereal water contains little nourishment
and, unless made from the whole grains, little mineral.</p>

<p>The ready-cooked oatmeals and wheat cereals should
be cooked not less than one hour for children.</p>

<p>The dry, ready-to-serve cereals are thoroughly dextrinized
and easily digested if well chewed, and therefore
as advantageous for children over two or three.</p>

<p><em>Eggs.</em> Eggs are quite easily digested raw, strained
through a fine sieve. Raw egg is usually laxative.
They should be cooked merely until the whites begin
to set and are like soft jelly. Or the grated yolk, after
boiling twenty minutes, may be used.</p>

<p>To soft boil. Place in boiling water which is immediately
removed from the fire; let stand eight to ten
minutes. Or put into cold water in covered saucepan;
bring to boiling point and remove saucepan from fire.</p>

<p>To poach. Grease the bottom of a small skillet with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
some fat. Put in boiling water with 1 teaspoon
salt. Drop in egg from saucer, and turn fire low, or
remove skillet. Let stand 2 to 5 minutes, until white
is set. Remove with perforated spoon or ladle. Serve
on toast which has been dipped in boiling salted water
and slightly buttered.</p>

<p><em>Cocoa.</em> For children four to eight years old, make
cocoa weak, using only ¼ teaspoon cocoa to a cup of
milk. Blend the cocoa with ¼ teaspoon sugar and 1
tablespoon boiling water. Add ½ cup of boiling water
and boil for five minutes. A larger portion may be
made at one time, and kept on ice. Heat the milk in
a double boiler and add the hot cocoa to this. Do not
let the milk boil.</p>

<p><em>Soups and Purées.</em> For thin soups, take equal parts
of milk and the vegetable water from cooking potatoes,
rice, spinach, carrots, celery, corn, lima or string beans,
peas. Heat in double boiler.</p>

<p>Purées are made by mashing and straining any of
these vegetables, and adding milk.</p>

<p>The most nutritious thickening is given by adding
cereal gruel, or raw egg beaten in just before serving,
after removing from the stove. Thickening of flour
or cornstarch requires cooking for half an hour. Flour
in melted fat is indigestible.</p>

<p><em>Vegetables.</em> Use fresh, tender vegetables. Sort carefully,
removing bruised and blemished places. Wash
or scrub thoroughly through two or three waters, using a
colander. If canned, remove all immediately from container.
For children under two years, potatoes should
be baked, and other vegetables cooked thoroughly
and put through a fine sieve, removing all cellulose.
For children of two and three years, vegetables should
be minced; for those four to eight years, merely diced.</p>

<p>Baked potato. Remove skin from two ends to
permit escape of steam in cooking. Bake in hot oven
until mealy—about forty-five minutes. Pierce with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
hot fork or break open slightly to permit escape of
steam.</p>

<p>Boiled potatoes. Boil in skins to prevent loss of
mineral nutrients. Put into boiling water; add 1
teaspoon of salt to each pint of water, and boil gently
for half an hour. Test with a fork, and when mellow,
drain off the water, remove the cover, and let the moisture
evaporate. If very large potatoes are used, add a
cup of cold water when the outside is cooked; this
prevents overcooking of outside portion.</p>

<p>Other vegetables may be baked, steamed (cooked
in a steamer), or stewed. The ordinary method of
cooking vegetables by boiling in a large quantity of
water removes the essential minerals and watersoaks
the vegetables.</p>

<p>Dried peas, beans, lentils, should be soaked overnight,
salted and boiled for fifteen minutes, then put
into the casserole or fireless cooker and cooked from six
to ten hours.</p>

<p>Young beets, string beans, lima beans, carrots,
spinach, peas, asparagus, summer squash are best
steamed until tender (from thirty to sixty minutes).
They may be stewed by putting in a covered saucepan
with just enough salted water to prevent burning, and
with the water just boiling.</p>

<p>Onions should be put into boiling water with 1
teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon soda, and a piece of charcoal
to 1 quart of water. After cooking five minutes,
pour off the water and add freshly boiling, salted water;
after ten minutes drain again and put into salted boiling
water. Boil until tender—forty-five to sixty minutes.
Leave the cover off to avoid odors. Spanish or Bermuda
onions are mildest in flavor.</p>

<p>In serving vegetables, add a little cream for young
children; omit sauces.</p>

<p><b>Serving.</b> Let the child eat outdoors whenever
possible. If indoors, have the room well ventilated
and not above 68° F.</p>

<p>Until six years of age the child preferably should have
his meals, at least dinner and supper, at separate hours
from the adults. He will give better attention to his
food, will not be tempted by adult food, and not subjected
to the table conversation which is too often directed
at him or not of interest.</p>

<p>A low chair and table is much to be preferred to a
high chair, until six years; then a higher chair, comfortable
for the dining table, with a foot rest, should be
provided, to be cut down as the child grows.</p>

<p>Serve milk at blood heat (98° F.) to children under
two years of age, and in cold weather for children to
six years. Serve warm milk for cooked cereal.</p>

<p>The serving plate for children under three should be
kept warm during the mealtime. Special children’s
plates are now procurable that have thermos qualities
or that are kept warm by hot water.</p>

<p>Avoid any possibility of infection. For example:
Do not return spoon or fork to child’s food, or give to
child, after you have used it yourself, or another child
has used it. Do not blow into child’s food; use some
other means of cooling.</p>

<p>Cereals should be fresh cooked within twelve
hours for children under two, and within twenty-four
hours for older children. Baked potatoes and eggs
should be fresh cooked for each meal. Vegetables,
soups, and purées should be cooked within twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Toast should be buttered when cold. If buttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
hot, the fat surrounds the starch grains and makes
their digestion difficult or impossible.</p>

<p>Cereal should be served without sugar or butter,
which make digestion difficult and form a rich combination
that spoils the appetite for simple, wholesome foods.
Top milk may be added, and for children two years,
chopped stewed fruit.</p>

<p>The digestive juices in the mouth have an important
part in the digestion of starches, therefore every means
should be used for the insalivation of starchy foods.
Dry buttered toast or whole wheat cracker, for instance,
eaten with cereal, necessitates longer chewing of
the cereal. The saliva is alkaline, and its action upon
starches is hindered by the presence of an acid; therefore
acid fruits, such as apple sauce, should not be taken
into the mouth at the same time as starchy foods, such
as bread, crackers, or cookies. Bread and milk are
more digestible when taken together, as the milk is
thus divided into smaller curds. Milk from a glass
should be slowly sipped, in small swallows; this is a
very important habit to cultivate in small children.</p>

<p>The diet should be carefully selected and analyzed,
carefully prepared and daintily served with the minimum
portions to meet the child’s needs. <em>With these
conditions</em> a child should be trained to eat what is
set before him, without argument, having a second
helping of the simple foods to the limit of his caloric
needs. Do not permit a child to be finicky about his
food. The tastes and food habits are formed in early
childhood.</p>

<p>Cultivate a taste for vegetables by giving first in
vegetable broths, and then gradually give a teaspoonful
of the mashed vegetable.</p>

<p>If a wholesome food is refused on first offering at
one meal, give that first at a subsequent meal and
withhold more desired foods until this is taken. Keep
dessert out of sight until other food is eaten. An occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
child is not able to digest some special food, as
milk, eggs, strawberries, fish. Some children cannot
digest plain milk but can take it in foods, as in broth,
junket, custard, pudding.</p>

<p>Common faults and tendencies in the child to be
guarded against are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
Insufficient chewing<br>
Eating too rapidly<br>
Drinking milk rapidly instead of sipping<br>
Dawdling over meals<br>
Eating with fingers<br>
Carelessness about the dropping of food on table and floor<br>
Unwillingness to try new foods<br>
Unwillingness to eat vegetables<br>
Preference for sweets and starches<br>
Overeating of bread<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Common faults of adults, in the feeding of children:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
Overfeeding<br>
Irregular feeding<br>
Allowing child to choose or refuse food and become finicky<br>
Giving too large a portion of bread and cereal<br>
Too much mushy food<br>
More than one quart of milk a day<br>
Insufficient hard foods<br>
Coaxing child to eat when not hungry or when tired or ill<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>School children should always have an adequate warm
breakfast, with plenty of time to eat without hurrying,
and a warm midday meal. If the school is too far
away for them to return home, some provision should be
made with the teacher, school principal, or near-by
home, for one or two warm dishes.</p>

<p>Children under six years should always have the
mother or other intelligent attendant with them during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
meals to train in careful chewing and drinking, neatness,
courtesy, conversation. With children under four
years a spirit of play may be brought into the feeding,
especially with the less desired foods; this should
gradually be dropped during the fifth year.</p>

<p>Utilize the opportunity for training in motor coördination
and self-reliance. Babies can be given water
from a spoon at one month, and can begin drinking
from a cup at six months; thus trained, they will
never acquire the bottle habit, and they can learn to
feed themselves during the second or third year. The
motor control and self-reliance thus gained are far more
important than the messing of food during a few months.
Let the children help clear their table (18 months);
brush up any crumbs (2 years); bring in their own
dishes and food (3 years); wash dishes (3 years);
help with the cooking (4 years).</p>

<p>Use enamel cups, sauce dishes, and plates until at
about three years the child can confidently handle
dishes without breaking them.</p>

<p>The serving of food has the value of a religious ceremony
and a social banquet, as well as the satisfying
of physical needs. With intelligence and forethought
it can be made of such significance, and a means of
teaching reverence, courtesy, self-control of physical
appetites, pleasant conversation.</p>

<p><b>The Purposes of Education.</b> Education is as comprehensive
as life itself. The education of the child
begins as soon as he is born. Every moment thereafter
is bringing influences that are shaping his character
and his mental life. The educator is the person who
acts as a mediator between life and the child, selecting
the environment and influences that will give the largest
values, helping him utilize, discriminate, and interpret
his own forces and those of the universe. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
work of the educator is analogous to that of the physician
or hygienist, who cannot give or increase life, but
can help the individual find the conditions that will
increase his own organic efficiency. Education by
trial and error, which is the method by which the race
has had to learn, is a slow, painful process. The purpose
of education is to reduce the wastage of life through
errors and to give all-around efficiency, valuable habits,
vision (ideals, ambitions, perspective), and command
of methods for continued learning. It should be a
preparation for larger living, not merely for intellectual
examinations or artificial tests.</p>

<p><b>Froebel, Hall, Dewey, Montessori.</b> The following
foundation principles are emphasized by these educational
leaders:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The function of education, serving to meet vital
problems and to increase both efficiency and richness
of life</p>

<p>2. The comprehensiveness of education, dealing with
the whole life of the child—his thinking, feeling, doing—during
every moment of his life</p>

<p>3. The moral purpose of life and therefore of education</p>

<p>4. The self-activity of the child as the method of
education</p>

<p>5. The daily life of the child in the home and family and
with nature as the natural environment for his education</p>

<p>6. The interest of the child as the basis of the curriculum</p>

<p>7. The study of the child as furnishing the key to
his interests, his development, his ways of thinking,
feeling, doing; and therefore the key to the methods of
education</p>

<p>8. The development of the child as an evolution,
progressing through a series of ascending stages which,
in the main, follow the same general order in all individuals</p>

<p>9. Adaptation of education for the individual child,
according to his nature and needs</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>The stages of development, the study of the individual
child, the outlines of the curriculum, and special
methods in selected phases of education, are discussed
in other chapters. The present discussion therefore is
devoted to the principles of educational psychology
and of pedagogy,—how to conduct the process of education.</p>

<p><b>Education, Instruction, and Training.</b> Education,
in the large sense in which the term is here used, includes
three pedagogical processes: (1) instruction;<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
(2) training; and (3) education<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> in its narrower
meaning,—the developing of the child’s innate powers.
Instruction is the easiest, but the most superficial and
least valuable; development is the most vital and
most difficult. Instruction is static; education is
dynamic. Training is the method for habit-formation
(which is a most essential phase of education through
infancy and childhood), the method for drill and
technical skill. The teacher must be able to discern
when each of these phases should be utilized. In
general, training should begin at birth, and habit-formation
should be continued unremittingly until
about the teens, although habits are fairly well fixed by
seven years. During youth and adolescence, training
is needed for acquiring of finer muscular and motor
skill. Instruction, directly, is easily overdone, and
the best general principle is not to give information
that the child could obtain directly for himself by a
reasonable amount of searching, use of his own observation,
experimentation, or reasoning; and not to overload
the child with a superfluity of unrelated information.
Certainly he should not be crammed with a mass
of facts in which he has no interest, much less those for
which he has actual distaste. There is danger that the
book will come between the child and the realities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
of life. Such instruction as is given should be in response
to a real hunger or interest. Education, the
developing of the self-activity of the child, should begin
in the first few days of life, and should be naturally
fostered through the careful selection of every factor
in his environment as well as through consistent cultivation
adapted to his stage of development.</p>

<p><b>The Biological Basis of Education.</b> Education is
possible only because the baby is born so helpless and
plastic, with many instincts, with the nervous system
great in its possibilities but incomplete in its development,
and with few habits formed.</p>

<p>Every stimulus that comes to the child is carried
by an incoming (sensory or afferent) nerve to the brain,
either directly or by way of the spinal cord. The
stimulus may come from an object, from an organic
sensation within the body, or from a thought. That
sensation or nerve impulse is carried to a nerve center
in the brain or the spinal cord, and there is transferred
to some one of the many outgoing (motor or efferent)
nerves, which conveys the impulse to some muscle,
producing a muscular action. For example: the rays
of light from a shining, moving object are the stimulus
to the child’s eye, and the optic nerve carries this
stimulus to a center in the brain. The little baby
must receive this stimulus many times before he begins
to interpret it. At a few weeks of age he will simply
stare, attempting to coördinate both eyes, or later, to
follow it with the movement of his eyes; later still, to
grasp for it with his hand. The optic nerve is here the
sensory or afferent nerve, bearing the sensation; the
nerve to the eye muscle or the hand is the efferent or
motor nerve. This circuit is what is meant by a
sensory-motor coördination, also called by some authors
a neuro-muscular coördination, or the reflex arc. Many
hundreds of these coördinations are to be made in the
course of each day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>The first time a specific sensation is conveyed to a
center, it is problematic which efferent or motor nerve
will carry the outgoing impulse, but the choice is of
great significance, for a habit is thereby begun. The
second time the same sensation is conveyed, it will be
easier for the same outgoing path to be followed. Thus
habits are formed. Each repetition fixes it more
firmly and makes more difficult the forming of a new
manner of reaction to that stimulus.</p>

<p>Every sensation and thought tends thus to express
itself in action. The little child is therefore especially
susceptible to suggestion. Inhibition is the intervention
of a second thought or stimulus which sends a
counter impulse that prevents the action. If the
expression of the action is continually prevented, or
if through weakness of will or low vitality the expression
is deferred, or not made, the power to express may
become weak, and the individual thus degenerate into
a mere dreamer. In extreme cases this becomes a
condition known as dementia praecox.</p>

<p>Nerves completely developed (and therefore efficient
for functioning) are covered by a sheath of tissue which
may be compared to the insulation cover of an electric
wire. At birth, few, if any nerves involved in voluntary
action or thought are completely sheathed. This
process requires many years, some nerves becoming
sheathed earlier, others later. A regular evolutionary
order is apparently followed, those nerves that control
the racially older sensations or movements becoming
sheathed and mature before the racially
younger. This is the biological basis of the stages of
development, and of the manifestations of different
interests. It is useless, often injurious, to attempt
to train a muscle or an interest before the nerves are
ready. When they are ready, ample exercise must be
permitted; this is the nascent stage of that interest.
If exercise is now neglected, the golden opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
for its education is passed. For instance, there is a
stage, from about ten months to six years, when the
special senses, as hearing, touch, sight are ripening.
This is the time for training in sense accuracy and discrimination.
The child’s spontaneous interests and
activities furnish the best clue we now have to this
development of nascent interests and the time for their
exercise.</p>

<p>In the brain there are apparently special centers
which receive the sensations from any one part of the
body and which send back to that part the motor impulse.
Thus there is a center for the arm, the hand,
the fingers, another for the ear, another for the eye.
Language has its special centers. This is the localization
of functions in the brain. At birth these centers
are undeveloped. In a right-handed child the language
centers develop in the left hemisphere, and in the left-handed
child in the right hemisphere. Ambidexterity
is frequently found with stuttering and with low-grade
mentality, and is not considered advantageous to
foster.</p>

<p>At birth, also, there is little or no development of
association fibers between the centers in the brain, or
between related centers in the brain and in the spinal
cord. These centers and the association fibers develop
through attempted use, as the baby receives stimuli
from without and attempts to respond. As a matter
of experience, the child learns to associate the several
qualities that are found together in one object, as the
taste, odor, color, “feel”, shape, of a piece of bread.
He also associates with an object his emotional states
at the time, as bread with the comfort of feeding, a hot
iron with the smart of pain, a ball with playful moods,
a church with awe or reverence, a thunderstorm with
fear or confidence. These early associations become
ingrained and remain with him throughout life or
with great difficulty are supplanted; they form his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
prejudices, his basis of morals and religion, his subconscious
self.</p>

<p>The reference of a stimulus from a spinal nerve center
to a brain center, and its transference in the brain to
a motor nerve, requires thought. Thought is necessary
for mental development, but it would be very exhausting
if every sensation had thus to be consciously responded
to. Nature is always working out short cuts.
When a response is uniformly through one motor
nerve, and a sensation is therefore uniformly followed
by the same action, the stimulus, instead of journeying
to the brain, transfers to the efferent nerve directly
from the center in the spinal cord,—that is, the action
becomes automatic. Not only thought but time and
nervous energy are thereby economized.</p>

<p>The time required between stimulus and response is
the reaction time. In an individual of phlegmatic
temperament the reaction time is slow; in the active
temperament it is quick, often impulsive. By a tonic
régime (involving cold baths, laxative diet, vigorous
physical exercise) the too phlegmatic may be developed
into more alert responsiveness. By a quieting, sedative
physical régime (increased sleep, rhythmic exercises,
freedom from stress) the too active temperament may be
toned down. Other temperamental changes may be
developed, especially during infancy and early childhood,
while the nervous system is still plastic.</p>

<p>The nervous system needs the stimulus of environment
for its development. If the eyes of a normal
baby were bandaged and his ears stuffed with cotton,
so he could receive neither sight nor sound stimuli,
and his arms and legs were kept bound tight so he
could not move, his mental development would be
hindered. If too many or too severe stimuli are presented,
the nervous system is irritated, confused,
overworked, and development is retarded. The child
himself will select from a normal environment the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
stimuli that he needs. Others should not be forced
upon him.</p>

<p>Whatever stimulus is exerting the strongest impression
will hold the child’s attention and direct his emotions
and action. If a child is himself absorbed with
some normal object or interest, it is tactless to attempt
to divert this to some imposed academic interest. If
he is in physical discomfort, it is a waste of time to
attempt to give him instruction until the discomfort is
removed. On the other hand, if a discomfort cannot
be removed, or if the object of his attention is morbid
or unworthy, the supplying of a more attractive counter-stimulus
(as the telling of an absorbing story or the
observation of activities out of the window, or doing
some other work with his hands) is the natural and
constructive method.</p>

<p><b>The Psychological Basis of Education.</b> Self-activity
is the natural method of education. This is Froebel’s
term. Rousseau called it learning to do by doing;
Dewey calls it education by development; Montessori’s
term is auto-education. Free play is the child’s self-activity,
when he chooses what he shall play, how, and
with what implements. Montessori calls this work,
when it is doing something useful or intellectually
educative.</p>

<p>The chief guide in the child’s self-activity is his
interest. In this connection interest signifies not a
passing whim or fancy but the child’s needs, the inner
urgings of his instincts, his nerves, and muscles. Probably
no one can know so well as the individual child
exactly what his needs and interests are at any given
time. The best the teacher can do is to know the
typical interests of children at the same stage of development,
and then to supply an environment that
will provide stimulus and the most valuable means for
exercise. For instance, at the noise-loving stage,
providing a great range of instruments, suited to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
muscular development, that will give good qualities
and range of sound, and accustom his ear to melodious
sounds.</p>

<p>Liberty, as Montessori means it, is freedom for self-activity.
Her meaning is often misinterpreted and
distorted, as will be noted from the following statement,
quoted directly from her “Method”: “The
liberty of the child should have as its limit the collective
interest; as its form, what we universally consider
good breeding. We must, therefore, check in the child
whatever offends or annoys others, or whatever tends
toward rough or ill-bred acts. But all the rest,—every
manifestation having a useful scope,—whatever it
may be, and under whatever form it expresses itself,
must not only be permitted, but must be observed by
the teacher.... If any educational act is to be
efficacious, it will be only that which tends to help
toward the complete unfolding of this life. To be
thus helpful it is necessary rigorously to avoid the
arrest of spontaneous movements and the imposition
of arbitrary tasks. It is, of course, understood that
here we do not speak of useless or dangerous acts, for
these must be suppressed, destroyed.”</p>

<p>The child’s life is a constant unity of physical-mental-spiritual,
of thinking-feeling-willing-living-doing.
Only for purposes of discussion should we attempt
to separate these. In education there is danger of
overemphasizing some one, especially the thinking,
of neglecting the spiritual, the feeling and willing, and
of ignoring the doing, the motor expression of the
thought.</p>

<p>In teaching anything new, build on what the child
already knows or is interested in or can do. Begin
with simple processes and proceed by gradual steps
to the more complex and difficult. The child thinks
in concrete terms, therefore let his instruction and
education be chiefly in concrete terms, at least up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
nine years. Let his learning come through living
experience, at first hand, so far as possible. Especially
avoid mere forms of words, without meaning and appreciation.
Cultivate initiative by following the child’s
problems, rather than by substituting your problems
for his and thus leading him to depend upon others for
such initiative.</p>

<p>It is a great responsibility of early education to cultivate
and plant many centers of normal interest, both of
thought and feelings. The wider the range of the child’s
normal interests and feelings, the greater the scope of
richness in his life. Intensive development of interests
has its period in youth and in later adolescence.</p>

<p>Any effort to force an interest is likely to result in a
reaction against the subject; an effort to force any
motor activity, as speech, walking, dancing, is likely
to result in strain of muscles and nerves, and ultimate
retardation. Too early an intellectual interest, of a
bookish sort, needs careful watching, to see that it
does not result in overstrain and later mediocrity.
Such a child, especially of the nervous, slender type,
may need to be diverted to wholly motor and outdoor
interests, for the sake of his future good. Genius
develops early, especially artistic genius, and needs
much physical life to maintain a balance. Mental precocity
often is not genius but a morbid development.
Infant prodigies are not the ideal, and it is a false ambition
to attempt to produce one. The mental powers
should not atrophy, but they should be exercised in
personal exploration, experimentation, construction,
getting acquainted with the natural world, learning
how to do motor work, and thinking leisurely on the
countless problems that present themselves to the
child’s own mind.</p>

<p><b>Sensory and Motor Training.</b> These begin almost
at birth and should proceed much together. The
sense of touch should be cultivated by having a variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
of shapes and sizes to handle from infancy; sound by a
variety of musical toys and agreeable noise-producing
implements; color and form by varieties of color in
toys and fabrics. Sense discrimination begins consciously
in the second and third year, and the child
should then have graded series of sizes, shapes, colors,
and sounds, to compare, match, discriminate between,
and arrange in order. The child should learn to discriminate
direction of sound, to judge of distances and
relative weights. Every possible advantage should be
taken of material about the house and in everyday life;
many simple games should be invented for testing of
sense discrimination and accuracy. Taste and smell
deserve but little attention. With a very sensitive
child a limited amount of sense-discrimination work
should be done; with a phlegmatic child much of
such training may increase his sensitiveness. Sensation
should never be stimulated as an end in itself
but as a means to perception and action.</p>

<p>Opportunity for exercise, and the simple exercises
given elsewhere, are all the child needs for motor
training during the first year. During the second year
he should be taught how to go up and down stairs, to
feed himself; and in the next year to dress himself,
the fastenings of clothing being in front or on the
shoulder, and the apparatus adapted to his fingers,
using snappers or buttons that he can manage. By
teaching rhythm, as elsewhere directed, marching and
skipping can be done as soon as the necessary muscles
and nerves are sufficiently developed. Swimming
can be learned at about four years. Muscles of trunk,
limbs, and hands (the fundamental muscles) should
be trained early; the accessory muscles—fingers,
eyes—are not ready for fine adjustments and training
until about seven years. Space and apparatus are
the chief needs in motor education, with occasional
help in technique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p><b>Language.</b> After the babblings of the first year, with
their natural voice gymnastics, language becomes a
matter of observation and imitation. Provide all
through childhood accurate examples of articulation,
grammar, and accent. The first impressions and speech
habits are relatively fixed. “Baby talk” to the child,
as incorrect articulation and pronunciation, may retard
normal speech a year or more, and give incorrect
words that will be a cause of embarrassment and cost
great effort to eradicate later. At one year the vocabulary
will include about four words. The child who
hears a wide range of vocabulary and who has his share
of stories, will naturally acquire a vocabulary of several
hundred words in the second year and about a thousand
in each succeeding year. Sentence formation begins
in the second year and should be cultivated in the third.
Sounds incorrectly given by four years should receive
special attention through brief imitation games, or
have the attention of a specialist. The simplest
rudiments of grammar may be given in youth, but
correct grammatical speech is chiefly a matter of good
examples in childhood. A large store of good adjectives
and exclamations will be the surest preventive of slang.
It is considered wiser to wait until about five years,
when the child has mastered the accent, practical
grammar, idioms and feeling for his native tongue,
before cultivating intensive acquaintance with a foreign
language. Such additional language teaching should,
of course, be by conversation, songs, stories, games,
following as closely as possible the natural method
of learning the mother tongue. A few conversational
phrases from a number of different languages will
broaden the child’s horizon. They should be given by
some one who speaks the language with native accent.</p>

<p>Reading and writing are further use of language
through symbols. They are slower forms of expression
than speech, and their acquisition at too early an age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
impedes the freedom of thought and may retard the
natural growth of thought and language powers. The
eyes and fingers are not ready for fine work until about
eight years of age. The child needs the outdoor life
and first-hand experiences. As a matter of general
observation, normal children with a natural environment,
who do not enter the traditional school until
about nine years, are able to proceed with children
of their own age who have spent three years in school.
The former children pick up reading at home, and have
acquired the physical development, power of initiative,
and expression, which enable them to cope fully as
well as, if not better than the earlier entering children,
with the problems of the school curriculum and of life.</p>

<p><b>Attention.</b> This is chiefly voluntary during the first
six years. The child is capable of intense and long
voluntary concentration. Avoid, so far as practicable,
interrupting the baby’s staring or the child’s absorption
in his play. The power of concentration thus developed
will remain to be utilized with any interest. For
necessary situations later, instead of attempting to
force involuntary attention in an uninteresting problem,
the more pedagogical way is to find the phase
of interest in the problem; then concentration will
follow automatically. To divert attention, provide
some more absorbing interest. The child whose
attention is absorbed should be spoken to only when
his attention is required. From babyhood he should be
trained to look directly at the person who is speaking
to him, to obey the first time spoken to, and to follow
a direction or command promptly without its repetition.</p>

<p><b>Observation.</b> Children naturally observe action
and striking or unusual characteristics. The range
of objects and qualities they observe may be greatly
increased by suggestion and by increasing their range
of interests. Definiteness and accuracy of observation
are increased by drawing, painting, modeling, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
any creative work, whether making a wagon or telling
a story, particularly after six years of age. Alertness
of observation is increased by games requiring quick
action for defense, protection, or to win a point, as in
“Drop the Handkerchief.” Observation of a larger
number of details, as well as quickness and accuracy,
are increased by asking for a description of persons or
objects, of articles in a store window or on a table, or
the imitation of a complex movement or series of
movements seen only once.</p>

<p><b>Memory.</b> Vividness of impression, variety of associations,
and repetition are the factors in memorizing.
The object or incident therefore must be clearly defined
and must have the child’s full attention. Fewer
repetitions will then be required. Obviously the child’s
interest is a chief factor in attention. Energy is therefore
economized by presenting data for memorizing
when the child is interested and consequently ready
for it. This applies very practically to formulæ, such
as the alphabet, new words, mathematical tables.
Rhythm and rhyme are easily memorized in childhood,
and valuable facts put in this form will be retained
longer. Such verbal memory is especially strong from
two to seven years. This period should be utilized
for teaching great thoughts, in poems and songs,
especially those with emotional value, great songs and
stories, chiefly in terms the child understands. The
facts will be forgotten, but the emotions and ideals
will remain with him through life. The period from
nine to twelve is the time for much rote learning.</p>

<p>The greater the number of senses on which an impression
is made, the greater will be the number of associations,
and the more tenacious the memory of an object
or incident. Different senses vary in the degree of retentiveness.
Things heard about are forgotten soonest;
things seen are remembered longer; things repeated
or actions done remain longest in memory. A few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
repetitions on successive days are more effective
than many repetitions on one day. Repeat as wholes,
in units of stanzas or paragraphs, instead of lines or
phrases.</p>

<p><b>Imagination.</b> Develop vividness and wide range
through exercise. In stories, put in colors and sounds.
Ask questions about a story, to bring clear pictures of
details. Encourage drawing, painting, and modeling
of illustrations, and the dramatizing of stories. This is
better training of imagination than to have stories
already illustrated. Fanciful imagination is poetic, and
some types of children are lacking in this. The child
should be trained not only in visual, but also in auditory
and motor imagery. Creation, whether of a
story, song, building, picture, or game, requires and
therefore trains imagination. Emotional imagination
can be trained in part through dramatic play, in part
through story-telling with this purpose. To be able
to put one’s self in another’s place is a basis for sympathy,
justice, and altruism. Between three and six
years, when imagery is vivid and exact knowledge of
the world is limited, many marvelous tales are told,
with no intention of deception. This is normal and
to be treated as fiction, in dealing with the child. Care
should be taken that it does not develop into intentional
deception for self-protection or vanity.</p>

<p><b>Reasoning.</b> A regular and consistent régime is an
early training in reasoning by association. Irregular
or inconsistent régime brings confusion of thought. At
five or six years of age, reason can be exercised by the
allowing of choice, in situations where the child has
some basis for passing judgment. Catering to the
child’s choice in food or clothing, on the other hand,
tends to develop whimsicality and dissatisfaction;
asking him what he would like, or if he wouldn’t like,
in any phase of his régime or play, has the same unfortunate
result. If his choice is to be served, ask him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
directly to choose, and thereby let him use his own
initiative in thought. Experimenting, taking things
apart, are natural exercises in analysis, and therefore
to be given widest possible opportunity. Building and
constructing require synthetic reasoning, and finding
the reasons for failures. Classifying of collections is
an exercise in reasoning. The brain centers of abstract
thought and reasoning are not developed until the adolescent
period. Frequent exercises in judging what
would be the best thing to do, or the best way to do,
should be made a training in practical judgment in later
childhood and youth.</p>

<p><b>Moral.</b> Precepts and laws can be taught through
stories, proverbs, and authoritative quotations. The
child needs some of these, as a part of worldly wisdom.
Much of this should be given during childhood. Every
story and situation should be analyzed to see what will
be its effect on the moral standards of the child. Moral
action, however, further requires the training of the
emotions, which are the springs of action, and the will,
which holds emotions within the dictates of reason. The
child’s moral ideals will be gathered more from the
character he sees about him, and the stories told him,
than from precepts. Good examples and daily practice
are the chief methods of teaching morals and
developing strong character. Respect for property
and law can be taught by providing the child with
property of his own, and regulating his life by an
orderly régime. The care of his own property and
responsibility for its orderliness will augment this.</p>

<p>Social virtues should be inculcated from infancy.
The baby’s cry for attention is a deep-seated individualism.
If encouraged, it makes later altruism more
difficult. Self-reliance and self-dependence, for physical
care and for amusement, should be systematically
developed, instead of constant care, waiting upon,
and amusement from others. Thoughtfulness for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
others can begin when the baby bites and slaps, though
in play, by showing him how it feels; in the little
child, by encouraging him to make little gifts or surprises
as daily events. Courtesy, kindly criticism,
loyalty to friends, freedom from gossip, he will learn
by imitation of those about him. For training in
generosity, he needs two or three other children about
his own age, from the time he is three years old.
Quarreling, which is an effort toward social adjustment,
is to be expected throughout childhood, and many
quarrels should be ignored, left to the children’s sense
of fairness and generosity to adjust. Tattling, bullying,
and resentful criticism should be shown in their
own ugly light and thus discouraged. Group games,
which the children naturally begin to play at six years,
are a good schooling in the practice of justice, fairness,
and social coöperation. Civic responsibility should be
cultivated from early childhood by the practice of
things that the children can do, such as keeping the
sidewalks clear of litter instead of scattering that
about. Patriotism should be taught chiefly as a
responsibility, rather than a form of excitement or
vanity. International sympathy can be cultivated
through sympathetic acquaintance with children of
other countries, through pictures and stories, dramatizing
of their ways, through personal acquaintance,
either directly or by correspondence. The roots of
international peace, or of strife and militarism, are
planted in the nursery.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">At the School of Mothercraft Summer Camp.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Emotions need training in expression, control,
depth, and genuineness. Submission and easy contentment
are not a virtue in childhood but a weakness. In
a strong character, emotions are strong, and their
expression strong, but needing guidance and poise.
Any emotion,—for instance, love of country, of
friends or parents,—should not be permitted to stop
merely with the pleasurable sensation of excitement and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>emotional glow, but the child’s attention should be
called directly and also by stories to the necessity for
putting a generous emotion into active expression, by
doing some helpful deed, or by carrying responsibility.
This is the completion of the reflex arc. Tantrums
and temper should be prevented whenever possible
by forewarning the child, for instance, that play must
end when the next block house has been finished. The
new adjustment of emotions and expectations is slower
in the child than in the adult, and needs forewarning.
Some children develop an unpleasant forwardness or
gushing, the former an overdeveloped individualism,
the latter a childish sensualism, both superficial.
Meeting these with indifference and inattention will
usually reduce them automatically. The child of very
intense or poorly controlled emotions needs careful
attention in a regular, outdoor physical régime, the
daily nap, rhythmic exercises and games which train
in relaxation, and constant examples of even-tempered,
well-poised character. The fear that commonly develops
in the third or fourth year may be somewhat
forestalled by teaching confidence through walking in
the dark, acquaintance with living creatures, trust in a
kindly Providence. Many stories of bravery should
be told in the fearsome period, and poetry or verses
taught that inspire courage and confidence. Fearsome
stories are a crime against childhood, although
later childhood and youth may thrive upon them.
Control of emotions is gained in part through determination
of will, in part through change of attention;
the latter is the more natural and pedagogical method.
Sense of humor should be cultivated for its moral
value in relieving tension and carrying the individual
through emotional stress, as well as for giving a clearer
view of comparative values.</p>

<p>Will-training includes exercise of free choice in
matters not of mere taste or whim but of reasoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and moral choice; and of continued effort against the
call of inclination. Stubbornness is a refusal to yield,
notwithstanding the evident reasonableness or the
greater moral value, and is evidence of a weak will. It
is now recognized as immoral to attempt to “break a
child’s will”, compelling him to yield without attempting
to show him the reasonableness. The burden of
reasoning and moral choices in daily life should be
placed upon the child as rapidly as he is able to exercise
this wisely and with firmness, and he should be praised
for his good will and shown the weakness of failure.
Confidence expressed in his good will, especially when
he is on his own honor, will strengthen this ability.
Training in control of appetite for food, by regularity
of meals, no eating between meals (especially of sweetmeats
when on pleasure trips), the waiting at meals
for the saying of grace and the serving of others, all
strengthen the will for greater demands upon it in
later years. Development of concentration in play
and games is a training of will-power. Special exercises
in motor balance and equilibrium, in endurance, in
self-denial, can be devised as further will-training.</p>

<p><b>Eugenics and Sex Education.</b> This is an education
in social ideals and relations. Consideration for the
child’s own future children is an instinctive ideal that
can be naturally fostered in early childhood, and thereafter
accepted as matter of course. Modesty, self-respect,
respect for his or her own person, needs to be
cultivated from infancy, in all the details of physical
care and régime. As childhood develops into youth,
the expression of affection needs to be increasingly
circuited into thoughtful deeds of service, and away
from mere direct sense pleasure and expression. Social
relations between boys and girls at all ages should be
treated sensibly, without silliness, emphasis of class
distinctions, or morbidness. In both boys and girls
should be cultivated a spirit of reserve, of chivalry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
helpfulness. With youth, this may naturally be based
on the ideal (which needs the merest suggestion) of
worthy preparation for the future home, and the treating
of other boys and girls as the child would have his
or her future mate meantime treated by others. The
significance of real monogamic marriage should be
made clear, in its greater confidence and happiness
between parents, and especially in the better care and
training of the children. The child needs to be provided
with inhibiting and controlling ideals before
the stress of adolescence.</p>

<p>The child’s natural biological questions, which begin
about three years, should be answered naturally, both
poetically and scientifically. Through the study of
plants, gardening, the care of birds and pets, enough
of the principles of heredity, anatomy, and physiology
should be given the child before seven years to satisfy
his curiosity, to give him a scientific attitude toward
reproduction before the development of sex-consciousness,
and to enable him to classify the development of
a new generation among the natural processes of nature,
instead of overemphasizing and distorting its perspective.
Emphasis should be placed upon the care of the
young and forethought for their protection, rather than
upon organs and processes. Scientific knowledge of
biology gives necessary clearness of thought, but only
training of emotions and will are effective for assuring
conduct.</p>

<p><b>Economics.</b> Thrift is taught by the toy bank, by
the orderly care and repair of toys and clothing, the
orderly saving of possibly useful odds and ends; in
early childhood by a weekly allowance, even of a few
pennies, with freedom in use, and with occasional
discussions of what might be obtained with a stated
sum. Promptness, accuracy, and thoroughness in
obeying or in performing the tasks assigned in childhood,
are preparation for industrial efficiency. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
early childhood action is necessarily slower and movement
awkward because of incomplete motor development.
In later childhood a vision of engineering efficiency,
a habit of working for reduction of time and
energy cost, can be developed through competitions,
direct reduction games or problems, discussions of the
value of time and energy and of simple, fundamental
ways for economizing. Through tracing the source of
his own food and clothing, as well as through his own
manual efforts, can be fostered respect for all labor and
the ambition to work efficiently. Respect and appreciation
for workers, especially those who serve his needs
in the household, are developed chiefly through example
of his elders.</p>

<p><b>Obedience.</b> Commands and prohibitions should be
the fewest necessary and chosen carefully. Given as
a request or suggestion rather than a direct command,
the form carries a sense of courtesy that develops
sympathy, self-respect and more ready, whole-hearted
compliance. Commands, when necessity requires, then
have greater force. Any request or command should
be given distinctly, definitely, kindly, firmly, with the
requirement of the full attention of the child and complete,
prompt obedience. Repetition of a command
fosters inattention and disrespect for authority. Indifference
to disobedience, yielding to teasing, permitting
petty arguing, all foster evasion, falsehood,
carelessness, disrespect for authority. Unnecessary,
unreasonable, or inconsiderate commands develop contrariness,
stubbornness, contempt, and weaken the
child’s sympathy and comradeship. Inconsistency in
commands, discipline, or punishment, or dogmatic
stubbornness that will not consider the possibility of a
change in the command or allow any discussion, brings
contempt. Use positive, affirmative suggestions, telling
the child what to do. Studiously avoid negative
discipline, prohibitions, don’ts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p><b>Discipline.</b> The purpose of discipline should not be
revenge or a cultivation of humiliation, or breaking
the will of the child. It should be devised to lead the
child to prefer the right; to think before he acts instead
of acting merely upon impulse; to exercise his
will-power and courage in obeying his conscience instead
of following the line of least resistance by yielding
to his whim, his appetites, or even to his instincts
out of due season. Therefore a rational, consistent
discipline must be well thought out for different typical
situations before these arise, that it may be administered
wisely, not impetuously or in anger. It must be just,
firm, kindly, foresighted. As nearly as circumstances
will permit, the child should learn through his personal
experience and observation the consequences of action;
and punishment should be, as far as practicable, a
natural consequence of the act. Artificial rewards,
especially in the form of material things as money,
toys, candy, are demoralizing, developing a spirit of
graft and discontent, dulling the moral and spiritual
sense, and having the effects common to any artificial
stimulants. Nagging, scolding, threats of punishment
without its execution, cultivate a disrespect for
all law and authority, as well as for the person thus
weakly failing to exercise poise and authority. There
is also a type of sentiment that easily becomes sentimentality,
which is no less repugnant to the child.
Cultivate the child’s self-respect, self-confidence and
ambition. Avoid calling him bad or naughty.</p>

<p>Discipline should be adapted to the child’s temperament,
to his stage of development, and to the particular
offense. A sensitive, high-strung, imaginative child
must be dealt with gently though firmly, with special
care that his self-respect, his confiding, his expressiveness
are not weakened. A sturdy, matter-of-fact,
phlegmatic realist usually needs more concrete,
vigorous, physical form of punishment to make him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
perceive the significance of events. The stubborn child
may be benefited most by being given opportunity to
prescribe his own punishment.</p>

<p><b>Some Natural Consequences as Punishments.</b>
Quarreling, disagreeableness, selfishness: being removed
from play with other children. Temper: put
quietly to bed, or left alone, or placed in bed with a
cold cloth on the head; with some children, spanking,
calmly administered. Biting, slapping or other personal
injury: doing same to the offender, to demonstrate
how it hurts. Impudence, vulgar words:
mouth washed with soap and clean cloth. Lack of
promptness: loss of consequent pleasure. Neglect
in care of toys: temporary deprivation of toys. Careless
work: repetition until satisfactory. Wanton
injury of property: work, or giving of some valued
personal property to pay for loss. Disobedience:
putting to bed; deprivation of consequent pleasure.</p>

<p>Reprehensible and unnatural forms of punishment
include putting child into dark closet; striking on
head or hands; punishing in presence of others; social
humiliation or other needless mental suffering; depriving
of a meal (although bread and water may be
substituted). Punishing without definite cause, or if
the justice is not clear to the child, is immoral. Punishment
should never be administered in anger but calmly,
firmly, with a spirit of regret but inevitableness.</p>

<p>To be effective, punishment should follow promptly
on the misdeed. Bedtime should not be a time for
scolding or discussion of faults but of happiness and
inculcating of ideals. To maintain due respect and
sympathy for father, as well as for the mother’s own
self and authority, there should be no threats of telling
father of misdeeds, or leaving punishment for him to
administer.</p>

<p>The problem of discipline is reduced to a minimum
when children have a regular, healthful physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
régime and diet, freedom from unnatural excitement,
abundant play space and material, consistent moral
training from infancy. Many little pranks and minor
misdemeanors should be overlooked. When, however,
the child has committed a serious wrong, or when one
form of misdemeanor (as lack of promptness) is becoming
frequent, or when the child has evidently done
something which he knows to be wrong, discipline should
be prompt and definite.</p>

<p><b>Habits.</b> Habits are formed by repetition of the
same action, in the same way. The first time the response
is made it makes a deep impression on the
nervous system, and change from the first doing is
most difficult. Every exception allowed or permitted
causes a hesitation or doubt that delays complete
formation of the habit. To prevent the formation of
a habit, prevent the first doing. The first time not
only establishes a path in the nervous system; it
establishes a mental attitude of familiarity and ease
with the action and its environment. To break a
habit, break it off abruptly and completely. Every
time the action is done, it is harder not to repeat it;
if it is a moral problem the moral fiber is weakened by
each yielding against conscience. A complete change
of environment, calling for a new adjustment of action,
is the greatest help in breaking an old habit. Some
constructive outlet for the energy should be provided.
The child’s sense of humor or disgust are moral avenues
of appeal in the formation of habits.</p>

<p>Habits of mental activity, of method of work, of
attitude toward life and people, of moral action, as
well as of motor action, are being formed from birth.
Life is conserved by training in good habits from the
start.</p>

<p><b>Religious.</b> No phase of education is more important.
Religion is a matter primarily of emotions and conduct,
rather than of philosophical thought. Little children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
are religious, but their religion is naturally very different
from that of the adult; they have much religious
feeling and thought, but little respect for ecclesiasticism,
creeds, rites, which mean nothing to them. The
child’s ideas of God are concrete, personal, related
to himself, as is all his thinking. He naturally thinks
of every object as being like himself, having power to
think, feel, and do; therefore he is easily a nature-worshipper.
Training of the religious feelings can
begin in infancy, in the development of sympathy between
parents and child, in confidence and trust in his
parents (who represent Providence to him), in gratitude
for their care, in obedience and respect for their
authority, and in wonder and awe for natural phenomena.
The child from four to nine years of age responds
readily to examples and suggestion of reverence.</p>

<p>Training in the performance of religious rites, such
as the saying of grace before meals, prayers, attendance
at religious services, participating in religious worship,
are motor habits readily acquired at about the same
age, which then remain as lifelong tendencies. If
neglected in this period, they are less likely to be formed
later. Even the motor attitudes of worship bring
some feeling of reverence and worship. Religious worship,
however, is not to be forced. To compel a child
to say a prayer or participate in any form of religious
worship against his inclination will foster a revolt
against all religion. When religious worship is a
natural and sincere part of the family life, the child
will naturally ask for a prayer to say, or for the privilege
of attending a service, when this interest is ready for
exercise. To allow a child to rattle off a prayer, or
say it inattentively, flippantly, or to show off, or to
permit him to treat any sacred place, objects, or rites
flippantly, is to foster irreverence and weaken the
religious sense. Service to God, to an ideal, to people,
as an integral part of religion, is an association that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
not instinctive, but one that the child needs to be
taught by example, precept, and training.</p>

<p>The child’s natural questions about the cause of
natural phenomena, the purposes and meaning of
life, the possibility and nature of death and immortality,
the nature of God, provide opportunity in due season
for the parent to answer these according to his own
conscience. The child demands definite, positive
answers, and has absolute confidence in the omniscience
of the person who answers his questions. How
to answer these so as to give the child a constructive
basis for thought and action, and yet not to be so dogmatic
that he will revolt when the questioning years of
adolescence arrive, is a problem requiring tact and
careful preparation.</p>

<p>Stories from Bible history, acquaintance with the
geography, customs, individuals of the Bible, are of
religious value because they develop centers of interest
and a personal acquaintance with the Bible, the textbook
of western religion, thus making it a living book
which he will naturally read for its moral and religious
content. Many Bible verses and hymns should be
taught during childhood and youth. These should be
very carefully selected to have some interest and content
of meaning for the child at his given stage of development,
although the depths of their meaning he can
only appreciate after more life experience. There may
be real danger of giving too early such significant quotations
as The Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments,
the Beatitudes, so that the words are memorized but
the child never receives the impress of their full significance.
Somewhere between six and twelve years they
are probably most appreciated. Doctor Hall considers
that to teach the child that there is a power which
makes for righteousness at the helm of the universe,
and that therefore right and wrong eventually have
their own deserts, is one of the most valuable factors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
in moral training. Certainly the stimulus of religious
inspiration, the inhibiting power of religious commandments,
motives, and ideals, the fortifying of will-power
by religious discipline and sources of strength, are
foundations for strong, efficient, well-poised living.</p>

<p>Education, like Christianity, is a spiritual process
with physical forms of expression. Just as church
rites, ceremonies, and equipment are meaningless and
wooden without the inner life, so are educational
“systems”, rules, and apparatus, without the spiritual
vision and understanding of education. There is no
virtue, for instance, in Froebel’s gifts or Montessori’s
didactic material, or any other mechanical devices,
merely as apparatus. The mechanical bringing together
of the child and the apparatus, without skill
or knowledge in their interpretation, is not educational;
and such irrational though well-intentioned effort is
unfair both to the child and to the inventor. No less
unfair and superficial is the seizing upon some one
principle and emphasizing it out of proportion to
other principles; or misinterpreting, through lack of
careful study, the significance of some principle, or
the author’s intent, as is so often done, for example,
with Froebel’s statement of play, Dewey’s statement
of interest, or Montessori’s statement of liberty.</p>

<p>The preparation of the child’s educators must begin
many years before his birth, that they may be ready
to meet this responsibility as soon as it comes. An
adequate preparation should include: (1) careful study
of the principles and purposes of education, that these
may be discerned clearly and applied with consistency
and discretion; (2) long schooling in habits which will
fit them to be worthy examples in character, in social
and mental traits, in tastes and languages; (3) some
experience with little children in daily life, in order
to learn to interpret and sympathize with child
nature, to acquire some facility in their education and
discipline, and to collect some fund of nursery lore.</p>

<p>“The ideal which has animated all my own feeble educational
endeavor, and without which I should be without hope in the
world of pedagogy, is the reconstruction of education based not
so much on existing conditions in society as on child-nature. It
is one thing to fit the child for a preëxisting social condition, and
a very different thing to develop all his own latent powers to their
uttermost and trust to their development for all future reforms.
Holding, then, as I do, that childhood has in it indefinite possibilities
that are some realized, some repressed or crippled, nipped
in the bud in a way for which home, school, and church must
share responsibility, and that if every spring of possible knowledge
and power were touched, even by the lightest suggestion at
its nascent psychological hour, we should in a few generations
develop a superior race of men, we have in this faith in the possibilities
of childhood and youth the most central and impregnable
of all the fortresses of optimism.”</p>

<p><b>How to Study a Child.</b> A complete study of the
child includes his physical and psychological characteristics,
personality, gifts, deficiencies, his heredity,
environment, training. In studying a child it is of
first importance to avoid carefully any stirring of his
self-consciousness, which might lead to either morbidness,
introspection, priggishness, or vanity. The necessary
physical measurements should be made as naturally
and impersonally as possible, without discussion. The
physical inspections should be made incidentally, during
the processes of the daily life, without comment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
Recording, except of measurements, should be done
without attracting the attention of the child,—preferably
not in his presence, and filed without his knowledge.
The child’s traits or characteristics should not
be discussed in his presence. Psychological characteristics
can best be studied under natural, usual conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
(1) in the child’s play: what he plays; how he plays<br>
(2) his stories: what he prefers or tells<br>
(3) his handiwork, especially his drawing<br>
(4) what he observes<br>
(5) his questions<br>
</p>

<p><b>A Score Card for Home Use.</b> The following score
card has been especially prepared to meet the practical
needs of the untrained layman and amateur in the
intelligent observation and better understanding of
normal young children. It does not attempt to include
marked abnormalities. It is merely preliminary
to a more detailed and scientific analysis by the specialist.
Such a general score card is necessarily applicable
only for certain ages. The following outline
does not attempt to cover special development beyond
ten years of age.</p>

<p><b>Physical Measurements and Inspection.</b> During the
first year the weight should be taken weekly, at the
same hour, in order to bear the same relation to feeding,
bath, elimination; other physical measurements and
inspections should be recorded at least quarterly. In
the succeeding years records should be made at least
semi-annually and preferably quarterly. The person
in charge of young children should observe daily the
physical conditions, and be able to detect at once the
special danger signals, or deviations from the normal.</p>

<p>Any person careful in details and accuracy can make
these measurements and inspections, at least as preliminary
to the specialist. Detailed directions are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
given in Pamphlet V, American Medical Association
Press, and in “The Health Index of Children” (Hoag).
For ordinary household use, the apparatus required
includes a new, firm tape measure, yardstick, accurate
beam scales, and cards for testing vision. For school
or institutional work it is desirable to have also calipers,
laboratory apparatus for taking heights, instruments
for taking blood pressure, and a dynamometer
for testing strength of muscles. Economic
and social conditions, differences of race and heredity,
will cause considerable variation among children of
the same age.</p>

<p><b>Psychological Analysis.</b> No generally accepted
standards or tests have yet been devised for measuring
psychological development. The standards developed
by Binet and Simon for mental ability as one phase of
psychological age, have been widely tested in this
country but have not proven wholly satisfactory.
American revisions are now being worked out. The
outline here given does not provide standards for measurement,
but depends entirely upon the judgment of
the person making the analysis. During the first year
a chronological record can profitably be kept of the psychological
development, noting particularly each gain
in motor control, every indication of increasing recognition
of sense impressions, the development of speech.</p>

<p>Standards of normal and average conditions and
development can be learned by:</p>

<p>(1) observations of numbers of children of the same
age.</p>

<p>(2) the study of published tables of measurements.</p>

<p>(3) published records, studies, and stories of children.</p>

<p>The Tables of Indications and Summaries have been
added to assist in gaining a clear picture of the child’s
condition and the factors calling for special constructive
measures, elimination, treatment, improvement,
or development.</p>

<span class="fs80">A CURRICULUM FOR BABYHOOD AND EARLY CHILDHOOD</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Knowledge has little or no intrinsic value in and of itself. Like
light, knowledge is good not to see but to see by.... Ignorance
is doubtless better than knowledge that does not make us better.”</p>

<p class="right">
—<span class="smcap">G. Stanley Hall.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“Where children are fed only on book knowledge, one fact is
as good as any other.”</p>

<p class="right">
—<span class="smcap">John Dewey.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“If we seek the kingdom of heaven, educationally, all other
things shall be added unto us—which, being interpreted, is that
if we identify ourselves with the real instincts and needs of childhood,
and ask only after its fullest assertion and growth, the discipline
and information and culture of adult life shall all come in
their due season.”</p>

<p class="right">
—<em>Ibid.</em><br>
</p>
</div>


<p>The curriculum is to center, not about “subjects”
in which the adult is interested but in</p>

<p>1. The child: (a) The phases of his life; (b) his
age and stage of development; (c) therefore the vital
interests characteristic of that stage; (d) his individual
interests.</p>

<p>It will be modified in some degree by</p>

<p>2. The environment and what it provides of opportunity
for physical activity, exploration, social relations,
and for direction of interest.</p>

<p>The apotheosis of unnatural environment for the
child is an expensive “high class” city apartment, no
other children, one or more domestic servants, absentee
parents who are interested and intelligent in everything
but child care and training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>For the child under six years, and possibly under ten,
the most educative environment, in every sense, is in
the country with hills, valleys, woods, water, plants
and trees, wild and domestic animals, other young
children, the freedom of the kitchen, the necessity for
personal physical care, and elders who enter sympathetically
into his life, not obtrusively but intelligently,
ready to give assistance when it is needed. With good
library facilities, wholesome neighborhood recreations,
and occasional trips to a city for its opportunities of
art galleries, great music, wholesome plays, industrial
activities, the simple home life and rural surroundings,
even with mediocre teaching in a rural school, provide
through early adolescence the environment most
favorable for developing richness of life, greatness of
personality, social efficiency.</p>

<p>As part of the environment which his guardians select
are (a) his clothes, which have an influence both upon
bodily health and on personality; (b) his furniture,
which should be adapted to his size; (c) his toys and
playthings, which are both a stimulus and a means for
expression of his interest; (d) his pictures, books, and
music, which are influencing his æsthetic taste, his
emotions and his moral life; (e) his associates, both
children and adults, who furnish the examples that he
imitates constantly in speech, manners, actions, and
whose personality subtly—and often unconsciously
is molding his personality.</p>

<p>The scope of education is as comprehensive as life
itself. The following aspects must therefore be developed
in the complete education of the child:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Disciplinary: developing in the child his power
to use efficiently his mental possibilities,—concentration,
observation, memory, imagination, invention,
judgment, his motor powers, his emotions, his will</p>

<p>2. Physical: training in habits and ideals of health,
in skill and grace of motor coördinations</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>3. Cultural: bringing the child to a living interest
in great literature, art, biography, history, and an
appreciation and enjoyment of their values</p>

<p>4. Scientific: leading him to a knowledge and appreciation
of the principles that control the world of nature
and of mind</p>

<p>5. Social: training him to live harmoniously and
serviceably with his fellows</p>

<p>6. Economic: fitting him to make his living by
service rendered, of marketable value</p>

<p>7. Moral and religious: developing character,—the
ideals and the realization of noble living,—which has
its roots deep in the feelings and the soul, and depends
upon these far more than upon mere thought, knowledge,
and reasoning.</p>

<span class="fs80">PLAY</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Play is the highest phase of child-development—of human
development at this period (childhood); for it is self-active representation
of the inner, from inner necessity and impulse.”</p>

<p>“The plays of childhood are the germinal leaves of all later
life; for the whole man is developed and shown in these.”</p>

<p>“Come, let us live with our children.”</p>

<p class="right">
—<span class="smcap">F. Froebel.</span><br>
</p>
</div>


<p>Play is spontaneous self-activity. It is not found
among lower forms of animal life. The length of the
play period with any species is directly related to the
degree of intelligence of which it is capable.</p>

<p>Young children instinctively play activities which
become work when they are mature, and which their
ancestors have practiced as work. Among animals,
play is Nature’s method of training for responsibilities
of maturity in food-getting and protection from
enemies.</p>

<p>Among the great educators of earlier days who have
recognized the value of play as a means of education of
children are Plato, Comenius, Rousseau, Locke,
Rabelais. Pestalozzi and Froebel were the first
modern educators to practically utilize play in the education
of little children, and the widespread interest
in play to-day is traceable to their efforts and influence.</p>

<p><b>Play and Work.</b> In play the individual expresses
his own desire, unhampered by artificial restriction or
repressions, limited only by his own strength, his
imagination, and the facilities of the environment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
Play is not necessarily easy, in the sense of making
small demands upon physical strength or mental
energy. Any one who watches children at their play
knows that the intensity of their interest and desire
leads them into work requiring the utmost of their
physical strength, endurance, and skill, and the greatest
exercise of imagination, initiative, judgment, patience
in the solving of problems; drudgery is performed
with relative ease, because it is appreciated
as a necessary means to a greatly desired end. There is
no value in drudgery as such. It is a part of the great
art of life to select motives and activities that are an
expression of self-activity, and to perform the drudgery
in the same spirit expressed by children in their
play. Drudgery becomes irritating when it is not
appreciated in its relation to an interest, as when it is
a task set by some one else, with no relation to the
life of the doer; or is the performance of labor for
others merely for pay, without any personal interest
in the work or its results.</p>

<p>The child must learn to perform many duties in his
own personal care, in the life of the household, the
family, and the community. It is of greater value to
put imagination and the play spirit into these, to learn
to make games of them, than it is to make dull, unimaginative
drudgery of them. During his fourth or
fifth year the child can begin to comprehend the values
of these tasks, in self-dependence, service to others,
coöperation in the advancement of human life, and
that he has the part of a worker to play in the great
game of life.</p>

<p>Learning, intellectual study, art, should by all
means be forms of self-expression, a development of
personality, a source of happiness in their acquirement,—play
in a large sense. If the pupil is unhappy,
disinterested, inattentive, the teacher or the
educational system is at fault in not having discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
the vital, instinctive interests of the child and his
natural, spontaneous way of learning. Better turn
such a child out for free play and first learn from him
what are his vital interests, and then utilize these, in
this play spirit, to bring to him content and discipline of
educational—that is, permanent and highest—value.</p>

<p>This ideal is practically possible by studying the
child’s instinctive activities and interests at any given
stage, and supplying (a) conditions in the environment
which permit his full and rich expression of these interests;
(b) content or goals that have permanent life
value; (c) increasingly difficult and more complex conditions
and problems, so that the child is advancing
in skill and ability.</p>

<p>For example: The baby likes to handle objects.
Cultivate this play interest educationally by giving
him objects illustrating a great number of shapes and
sizes. Utilize his love of sound by letting him hear,
every day if possible, some good music. The three-year-old
child loves to dramatize. Teach him good
manners and courtesies in playing “tea-party” and
“visiting”; instruct him in simple first aid and
hygiene through playing “doctor.” Later, tell him
great stories from the myths, from history, from classic
literature, that he can “play out.”</p>

<p>At about five years of age children instinctively pour
and measure. Instead of leaving this to chance
play, it is possible to make it of permanent (educational)
value by providing (a) a play space for various kinds
of measuring; (b) a variety of substances to measure,
as sand, sawdust, pebbles, water, colored water, long
strips of paper, cheap tape or cloth, clothespins, even
“real” fruits and vegetables; (c) standard measures,—pint,
quart, gallon, dry quart, peck, bushel; later,
gill and ounce, and the pound and ounce weights;
(d) bottles with wide mouths, and other receptacles for
pouring into, that will cultivate steadiness and carefulness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
Begin with two or three measures, teaching their
relation, as pint and quart, gradually adding more as
these become known. Give at first measures and bottles
easy to pour into, later those more difficult, requiring
better coördination. Set a standard of neatness
and accuracy. Watch for indications of fatigue and let
the play stop before there is any strain.</p>

<p>Normal children in a normal environment do not
wish to be amused, but they are full of ideas of their
own that they wish to express. The adult very often
desires to amuse children,—not primarily for their
benefit but for his personal pleasure in watching them
and participating with them; he (or she) needs a
training in self-control and a deeper understanding of
child nature, that he may come to find as keen satisfaction
in standing aside and watching the child’s
self-development, bringing forward his own personality
only where it will be of educational or social value.</p>

<p><b>Children’s Parties.</b> Children’s parties may be a
means of social, physical, and spiritual grace, or they
may be made a cause of nervousness, dissipation,
corruptive ideals. As a means of grace, they should
(a) be held in the daytime and last about two hours for
children under six, three hours for the older group;
(b) preferably outdoors; (c) include a small group of
guests—only four or five for children three to five
years, ten or twelve for children five to seven, and
about twenty as a maximum for children seven to ten;
(d) require simple dressing; (e) little preliminary
excitement of preparation; (f) games carefully conducted,
and alternated with stories to prevent fatigue
or too much excitement; (g) a small amount of very
simple refreshments, as fruit juice and lady fingers, or
milk and animal crackers for children under five; or a
small portion of pure ice cream and sponge cake for
children five to seven; or a small amount of simple
candy, nuts, popcorn for children over seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p><b>Play Room and Ground.</b> The best playground is
the home yard, where mother can keep an oversight;
where other children can come so she knows the playmates,
and where the child is kept in sympathy with
home influences. For indoor play, there should be a
room kept sacred to the uses of childhood. In this
way both adults and children have more freedom, with
less conflict of comfort and convenience. For children
under three or four years this room will naturally be
the nursery; for older children it should include facilities
of a workshop.</p>

<p>The playroom should be well lighted and ventilated,
with floors bare except rugs for small children to
sit upon. The walls, curtains, and rugs should be
washable. The color scheme should be cheerful and
attractive to childhood. Yellow, warm gray, or green
are especially good; red is too stimulating; violet is
oppressive. Touches of rose or light blue might be
added. The wall covering should preferably be a
hard paint or Sanitas, at least to a four-foot wainscoting.
Pictures should be easily removed, frequently changed,
arranged with some regard to unity and symmetry.
Pictures for little children should be hung low enough
to be easily seen.</p>

<p>The furnishings should include tables adapted to
the child’s height, chairs of hygienic design, cupboards
and window seats for toys, apparatus, tools, books,
where they will be kept out of the dust and in a reasonable
order. The children should be responsible
for the orderliness of rooms and cupboards, good condition

<p><b>The Value of Games.</b> All games are play, but not
all plays are games. In a game some rule is involved,
some goal or object is to be attained. Usually, though
not always, in a game, two or more play together.</p>

<p>Most children under three years of age, and many
under four, have not developed sufficient self-control,
imagination, memory, and judgment to play a game.
If “Hide-and-Seek” is attempted, they will run out
of the hiding place before they are discovered. In
“Hunt the Thimble”, they will point out where the
object is hid. They are with difficulty held to the
sequence of circle games, except of the simplest sort.</p>

<p>At about four years, however, most children have
the mental and social development to find interest in
circle games, traditional games, and some competitive
games.</p>

<p>Supplementing the educational values of play in
general, different games have some of these additional
educational values:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Training in social relationships, in group action,
coöperation, competition</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Cultivating a sense of social interdependence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Sharing experiences with mates</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Subordination to the rights, desires, and leadership
of others</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Loyalty to a leader or a group</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Incentive to improvement of skill in order to compete
with others</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Acceptance of the consequences of failure or inefficiency</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Opportunity for leadership to him who is able</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Realization of law, through rules of game</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Measuring of personal ability and personality with
that of mates</p>
<br>

<p><b>Kinds of Games.</b> Games may be classified according
to</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) the degree of physical activity involved;</p>

<p>(2) the degree and kind of mental activity required;</p>

<p>(3) the moral and social traits cultivated.</p>
</div>

<p>Each of these groups would be subdivided according
to age, although some games seem of interest at any
age.</p>

<p>With little children in the home it is convenient to
have at hand a classified list. This list should begin
with the standard games, and be lengthened as new
ones are found or, better still, are devised by the
children.</p>

<p>Any game tried should be interesting, “fun”, that is,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) suited to the physical powers and mental development
of the child;</p>

<p>(b) expressive of his spontaneous interests.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Certain activities have play interest at every stage
but could be played only in a very simple, brief game
under four years, and for a longer time and more complexly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
after that age. These most common activities,
or motifs, include surprise, imitation, observation,
guessing, hiding, seeking, catching, chasing, running,
ball play. The worker with young children should
be able to invent many little games based on these
motifs. Simple little songs, invented, spontaneously
improvised, or gathered from kindergarten songbooks,
add joyousness to the game, cultivate a love and expression
of music, and teach the utilizing of art in
everyday life.</p>

<p>Games may be analyzed by the following scheme,
to discover their values.</p>

<p>Every game involves some attention and conformity
to rules. “Follow the Leader” involves activity,
careful observation of the leader’s movements, imitation,
alertness, motor control, and reasoning in guessing;
if trade is represented, the leader must exercise ingenuity
and initiative in thinking of a new movement.
“Spin the Platter” and “Drop the Handkerchief”
require mental alertness intermittent with attention.
“Cat and Mouse” and “Hawk and Chickens” require
physical alertness, dexterity, and quick judgment.
“Ring-around-a-Rosie” involves rhythm,
chanting, and a bit of the ludicrous. “Charlie Over
the Water” is a step further, involving mental
and physical alertness. “Little Sallie Waters” and
“Farmer in the Dell” involve love of rhythm and
music, dramatizing, and the choice of a partner.</p>

<p><b>Three to Four Years.</b> Children are usually not yet

five or six years. At this age children can play together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>

among themselves. They are able to play simple
games with an adult. The parent or teacher can

<p>Sense Games. These involve the “guessing” interest
but require thought.</p>

<p>Sight and Observation. Tell what object, color,
form is taken away from a group, or added. Match
a color or form of flower or other object, first with
object in hand, later from memory. “I saw”—relating
what was seen on a walk, in a room, or when passing
a store.</p>

<p>Touch. Tell the name of an object or form by
handling it while blindfold.</p>

<p>Hearing. Tell the direction of a sound, instrument
sounded, person speaking, while blindfolded.</p>

<p>Language Games. Many can be invented similar
to the following, in which increase in speaking vocabulary
is gained. Nouns: I went to the Zoo (store, boat,
etc.) and there I saw—(name objects). Verbs: A
train (bird, dog, wind, etc.) can—(name activities).
Adjectives: I like squirrels (flowers, dolls, apples, etc.)
because they are—(name adjectives).</p>

<p>Alertness. Children at this age, and until six, are
often dawdling, dreamy. Games can be invented to
cultivate dispatch and alertness, as “running a race”
with a person or the clock, in dressing and undressing.</p>

<p>Poise, Relaxation, Concentration. What Montessori
calls the “Game of Silence” cultivates these qualities.
As played in the Montessori schools, the children sit
quietly, relaxed, in a room slightly darkened, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
all sounds are hushed, and all listen. After two or
three minutes some one in an adjoining room whispers
or calls faintly the name of a child, and the child goes
as softly as possible, returning as softly. Ten or fifteen
minutes is the limit of the children’s ability to
play the game. Forms of it may be played when going
through the house, or whenever quiet is especially
desired; or when the children are becoming irritable
or too nervous.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The imitative, imaginative, and dramatic play instincts
of the years from three to six offer opportunity
for a wide range of invention of games. These should
not be formal but by their very nature must give freedom
of initiative, imagination, and self-expression.
They may be utilized, for instance, in social training,
as in playing that the child is a prince or princess at a
banquet, or is a parent to the doll who sits near by to
be taught, making a game of neat table manners or
careful chewing. They may be utilized for moral
training, as in playing that the child is the fairy godmother
who could bring sunshine wherever she went;
or Siegfried, who could kill all the dragons of ugly
temper or words.</p>

<p>“Choose his toys wisely and then leave him alone with them.
Leave him to the throng of emotional impressions they will call
into being. Remember that they speak to his feelings when his
mind is not yet open to reason. The toy at this period is surrounded
with a halo of poetry and mystery, and lays hold of the
imagination and the heart.</p>

<p>“When we have restored playthings to their place in education—a
place which assigns them the principal part in the development
of human sympathies—we can later put into the hands of
children objects whose impressions will reach their minds more
particularly.”</p>

<p class="right">

<p><b>The Toy Age.</b> When the baby first begins to grasp
objects and stare at them, the toy age begins, that is,
at about four weeks. It increases rapidly in force
during the first year, and from two to about ten years
is in its height. It declines with the approach of adolescence
and by twelve is devoted chiefly to apparatus for
games. It wanes With the decline of imaginative play
and gives way to the interest in reading and industries.</p>

<p><b>Education through Toys.</b> Toys, as the child’s
constant, most intimate companions and most used
implements during these impressionable years, inevitably
have a marked influence upon his character and
development. Froebel was the first great modern
educator to appreciate the significance of a child’s
toys, and to apply himself to the task of selecting and
inventing those that would best develop his creative
self-activity, his personality and happiness. The
blocks or “gifts” that he devised are valuable for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
simplicity, their variety of form, and their purpose of
giving to the child an increasing number of forms as
he grows in imaginative and constructive ability.
Froebel did not appreciate, as modern biology has
taught us, that the little child is in the stage of fundamental
muscle activity, and that the accessory muscles
(finer muscles, of fingers and eyes) do not develop completely
for steady use until after six or seven years.
Froebel, therefore, used the 1-inch cubes, which hygienists
to-day discard for the larger size,—at least
2-inch for table use and paving-block size for floor use.</p>

<p>How far are children’s expressions of desire for toys,
as they visit a toy shop, an index to the value of these
toys, or their permanent interest in them at home?
Relatively slight. Here again it is necessary to distinguish
between the child’s passing whim and his
vital interest. Children are momentarily attracted by
the gorgeous, the vivid-colored, by noise, rhythm,
motion, the imitation of adult activities. This explains
their superficial interest, while in a toy shop, in
the realistic French doll with wonderful clothes and a
speaking voice, in the mechanical toys, the flimsy
little nonentities. At home, in the playroom, the
flimsy nonentities are soon broken and cast away without
more than a ripple of emotion, and the realistic
French doll languishes alone in her glory, while plain
Mary Jane receives the daily ministrations of affection
and comradeship.</p>

<p>It is these factors of glitter, noise, rhythm, imitation,
physical activity, combined with the possibilities of
movement and counter-movement, augmented by the
attitude and remarks of their elders, who, assuming
the reasonableness of war, praise military activities,
that explain the child’s interest in military toys. Any
other toys that have these same qualities will hold the
child’s enthusiasm as well. Engines, trains and their
crews, fire engines and firemen, steamboats and sailors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
life-savers, fishermen, policemen, mines and miners,
steeplejacks, divers, carpenters, painters, farmers,—there
is a great range of possibilities. It is true many
of these are not yet to be had in the toyshops, but they
will be found there as soon as the demand is sufficient.
It should be noted, in passing, that the military toys
have been imported from foreign countries, where war
has been considered the climax of virtue, and where
little children, especially in the royal families, were
systematically imbued with a spirit of military prowess.
The consequences are written so large that “the wayfaring
man though a fool cannot err thereby.” International
peace will begin in the nursery, in the training
in ideals of activity and heroism that are constructive
and helpful, not destructive.</p>

<p>In “A Story of a Sand Pile”, Doctor G. Stanley
Hall comments: “It is a striking feature, to which I
have observed no exception, that the more finished
and like reality the objects became, the less interest the
boys had in them. As the tools, houses, etc., acquired
feature after feature of verisimilitude, the sphere of the
imagination was restricted, as it is with too finished toys,
and thus one of the chief charms of play was lost.”</p>

<p><b>Dolls.</b> In a questionnaire-study made by Clark
University of children’s interest in dolls, eliciting returns
from nearly a thousand children, the following
interests were noted.</p>


<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">(a)</td>
<td class="tdl">The favorite dolls were simple, even rude, with few accessories, curly hair, four to twelve inches in size, could be washed and handled in every way, taken everywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">(b)</td>
<td class="tdl">Dolls representing children or adults were preferred to baby dolls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">(c)</td>
<td class="tdl">Interest in very small or very large dolls, and paper dolls, developed after eight or nine years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">(d)</td>
<td class="tdl">Boys preferred dolls representing monkeys, animals, heroes, dragons, etc.</td>

<p>Quoting from Doctor Hall’s comments on this study:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The educational value of dolls is enormous. It
educates the heart and will even more than the intellect,
and to learn how to control and apply doll-play will
be to discover a new instrument in education of the
very highest potency. Every parent and every teacher
who can deal with individuals at all should study the
doll habits of each child, now discouraging and repressing,
now stimulating by hint or suggestion.</p>

<p>Too many accessories lessen the educational value
of this play in teaching children to put themselves in
the parents’ place, in deepening love of children, and
of motherhood. Children with French dolls incline to
practice their little French upon them; can this tendency
be utilized in teaching a foreign language to
young children?...</p>

<p>The rudest doll has the great advantage of stimulating
the imagination by giving it more to do than
does the elaborately finished doll. It can also enter
more fully into the child’s life, because it can be played
with more freely without danger of being soiled or injured.
With rude dolls, too, the danger both of hypertrophy
and of too great prolongation of the doll
instinct is diminished. The child’s interest is opposed
to large, elegant French dolls which teach love of dress
and suggest luxury, and dolls with too many mechanical
devices, as for winking, walking, speaking, and singing,
against which the Russian Toy Congress has so strongly
protested. Rather small and durable dolls, soft enough
not to hurt, flexible, with two or three colors and not
more than two or three garments, along with plenty of
hints regarding clothespins, flowers, and other varied
material,—something like this seems to be the suggestion
for a first doll, with increasing variation in size,
material, elaborateness, and number till the doll
passion vanishes in two dimensions, with innumerable
paper dolls, towards adolescence.</p>

<p>That boys are naturally fond of and should play
with dolls as well as girls, there is abundant indication.
One boy in a family of girls, or boys who are only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
children, often play with dolls up to seven or eight
years of age. It is unfortunate that this is considered
so predominantly a girl’s play. Most boys abandon
it early or never play, partly because it is thought
girlish by adults as well as by children. Of course,
boy life is naturally rougher and demands a wider
range of activities. The danger, too, of making boy
milliners is of course obvious, but we are convinced
that, on the whole, more play with girl dolls by boys
would tend to make them more sympathetic with girls
as children, if not more tender with their wives and
with women later. Again, boys as well as girls might
be encouraged to play with boy dolls more than at
present, with great advantage to both. Boys, too,
seem to prefer exceptional dolls, clowns, brownies,
colored, Eskimo, Japanese, etc. Boys, too, seem fonder
than girls of monkey and animal dolls, and are often
very tender of these, when they maltreat dolls in human
shape. Again, dolls representing heroes of every kind
and non-existent beings, dragons, and hobgoblins find
their chief admirers among boys.</p>

<p>It seems to be about the age of six, three years
before the culmination of the doll passion, that the
conflict between fancy and reality becomes clearly
manifest. Abandonment to the doll illusion and the
length of the doll period decreases as dolls and their
accessories become elaborate. With every increase
of knowledge of anatomy or of the difference between
living tissue and dead matter, between life and mechanism,
this element of doll play must wane.</p>

</div>


<p><b>Mechanical Toys.</b> Doctor Hall comments on this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Mechanical toys, more than any others, seem to
have the shortest existence in the hands of bright, active
children, a fact which suggests that toys so constructed
as to show principles of motion and elementary physical
laws, without involving their own destruction, are
an educational need yet to be supplied. This destructive
form of curiosity, due to normal development of
mentally active children, needing guidance, and to be
furnished with a proper outlet, but not repressed, is
not to be confused with the careless destruction of toys,
due to lack of interest, which is unfortunately common
in children whose interests and powers of appreciation
have been weakened and dissipated by overloading
them with toys and diversions until it has bred in them
an ennui which has sapped their power of attention
and left them incapable of self-entertainment. Healthy
children, if allowed to develop under normal conditions,
find interests and amusements for themselves, and the
child who has been so reared that he wants to be constantly
amused, and has no keen desires because they
have been too frequently anticipated, has been deprived
of one of the rights of childhood.</p>

<p>A baby’s early motor interests are in the things
which he himself can do, and disappointed friends and
relatives have often found their gifts of mechanical
toys a failure, simply because they have too far anticipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the natural development, and the toy has proved
either a source of fear or failed to excite special interest.
In fact, even at a later period, mechanical toys which
are too complicated in construction or too delicate to
bear investigation, which are apt to be clumsy, soon
lose their attractiveness, while something that can be
taken to pieces and put together by unskilled fingers, so
that it will “go again” may prove of continued interest.</p>
</div>

<p>And Kate Douglas Wiggin writes: “Every
thoughtful person knows that the simple, natural
playthings of the old-fashioned child, which are nothing
more than pegs on which he hangs his glowing fancies,
are healthier than our complicated modern mechanisms,
in which the child has only to press the button and the
toy does the rest.”</p>

<p><b>The Treatment of Toys.</b> The right treatment of
toys has far-reaching educational values in orderliness,
thrift, prudence, depth of emotion, generosity, genuineness.
The child who has a small number of durable
toys that will stand the strain of usage and therefore
accumulate years of associations and emotions, is
having an education in genuineness and emotional
strength, while the child who has a great number of
flimsy toys that rapidly disappear is being trained in
superficiality and shallowness. The child whose toys
are promptly repaired when broken is being trained in
prudence and orderliness, and still more so when, even
during his second year, he is responsible for keeping
them orderly and neat. The child who is surfeited
with gifts, or who is allowed to spend his pennies prodigally
for cheap jimcracks, is being trained in extravagance,
shortsightedness, and discontent; while the one
who is given a reasonable number of gifts and is taught
to save his pennies and think carefully of worth-while
toys to buy, is being trained in thriftiness, foresight,
and satisfaction.</p>

<span class="fs80">STORY-TELLING</span></h2>
</div>


<p><b>Value of the Story.</b> Story-telling is the true pedagogical
method of instruction, and to some extent of
education, in early childhood. The story has many
values, spiritual and intellectual. The wise teacher
will use it to (1) entertain, (2) enlarge the experience
by giving pictures of other children, homes, lands,
social and geographic situations which no one child
could experience, (3) acquaint the child with world
characters and literature, (4) increase the vocabulary
and the use of language, (5) cultivate imagination and
concentration, (6) portray the effects of wisdom or
foolishness, (7) present ideals of life, (8) give inspiration,
courage, faith, sympathy.</p>

<p><b>What to Choose.</b> Stories should be selected that
will give the greatest number of these values, and that
are suited to the stage of development of the children
to whom they are told. In this age of cheap
printing and authorship, the mediocre is always at
hand, and the most valuable must be searched for as
precious jewels. Life is so brief that there is not time
even for all of the best.</p>

<p>The best story must first be true, not necessarily
in a realistic sense of having actually happened to a
certain individual in a historical time and geographical
location, but it must be true in expressing the eternal
verities, the principles that govern the universe.
This rules out the tale in which error or vice succeed,
or in which brute strength conquers spiritual strength.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
In the “true” myth, fairy tale, or allegory, Right
eventually triumphs as it actually does in the universe,
although possibly long delayed; wrong is punished;
error and ignorance bring their unhappy consequences;
wisdom and skill conquer circumstances; and the
forces of the universe (whether presented as natural
forces or as gods, fairies, or Providence) assist those
who strive for righteousness and to assist their fellows.</p>

<p>It must next be vital. No less vicious and undermining
than the untrue story is the weak, sentimental,
mawkish, dull, or mediocre tale. In the reaction
against such, and for want of a guide, children of
reading age resort to sensational, flamboyant, lurid
tales found on any cheap stationer’s counters and even
in respectable editions in these days. Other children
unfortunately take to such pabulum temperamentally.</p>

<p>It must also be positive, not negative. Moreover,
the grewsome, harrowing story, the hypocritical, the
morbid, are equally a crime against childhood.</p>

<p>The story must be of interest to the children. It
must, therefore, have action, dramatic quality, and
for children under six, repetition, humor of situation,
fun, brevity, rhythm.</p>

<p><b>How to Tell Stories.</b> For the person who “cannot
tell a story” as for the person who “cannot swim”,
there is one essential: forget <em>yourself</em> and plunge in,
and practice until you have gained confidence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">1. Tell something in which you and the children
are interested, and keep at it repeatedly until
you feel at ease.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">2. Recall stories that interested you at that age.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">3. Tell stories the children themselves ask for,
refreshing your memory by reading up a standard
version, or by asking the children to tell
it to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">4. Study Mother Goose, Æsop, and Bible stories
as models of the best story-telling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
5. Live the story as you tell it—see it as pictures
in your own mind. Tell it so vividly that the
children can play it out afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">6. Use direct speech in telling conversation.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">7. Make your pictures vivid by a few descriptive
words, especially of colors and sounds; increase
your vocabulary of adjectives.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">8. Beware of making it too long, especially for very
little people.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">9. Use perhaps a very few natural gestures, but
do not try to act it out. Children have not the
mental ability to hear narrative and see action
at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">10. Children love the same story repeated, and they
want it told <em>the same way</em>, in order to see the same
pictures; therefore have your story clear in
your mind the first time you tell it.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">11. If you are telling a classic or standard story,
respect it as it is, just as honestly as you would
an historic or scientific fact. If you do not
wish to tell it that way, don’t tell it at all, but
don’t tinker it.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">12. Do not try to memorize a story, except possibly
the conversations.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">13. If a story is clearly told, the child will usually
absorb and discern the ethical principle involved,
without any necessity on your part to obtrusively
“point the moral.” Sometimes a
child will draw an erroneous or unexpected inference
because his judgment is yet immature or
his ethical experience is elementary or perverted.
Under such a condition, try to tell another story
that will concretely clear his thought.</p>
</div>

<p>When you are able to tell a story spontaneously,
joyfully, forgetting yourself, losing yourself in the
story and in the children’s interest, you will be ready
to study story-telling as a science and an art, and you
will have learned by your experience some of the fundamental
principles of the art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>The first requisite, however, is spontaneity, naturalness,
self-confidence. To attempt to study method
before attaining this quality is to incur the danger of
substituting “finish” for vitality.</p>

<p><b>Times and Occasions.</b> For effective story-telling
choose the time when the child can give attention, and
when the environment is without disturbing influences
of noise, sights, other interests, interruptions. There
are occasions, however, when the child is restless, tired,
irritable, when a story that has much of rhythm and
repetition will soothe him.</p>

<p>It is certainly unwise to try to secure his concentration
when he is hungry, or eager for active exercise.
Bedtime stories usually should be told before the child
is undressed, and should be of a quiet, sedative kind,
that the child may not be kept awake either through
excitement, or thinking on vivid pictures.</p>

<p>Let the child have opportunity to absorb it into his
soul. Therefore wait for the child, in his own time,
to give it back, either by telling it, dramatizing, painting,
drawing, cutting, modeling. This will foster the
child’s initiative. When the child himself asks “What
shall I do” is time enough to suggest directly such
reproduction. Meantime, as a means of suggestion,
it is valuable thus to illustrate a story yourself some
time after it is told—immediately or some hours or
days later. When the child is ready, he will imitate
and ask to do it also, but his response should be spontaneous
on his part, and of his own initiative.</p>

<p><b>Selection of Stories.</b> Story-telling naturally begins
in the latter part of the first year, with simple finger
plays, and the cadence of Mother Goose. Here
belong “This Little Pig”, “Open the Door”, “Ride a
Cock Horse”, and other simple rhythmic nursery
rhymes.</p>

<p>In the second and third year, more of the simple
finger plays, such as “Here’s a Ball for Baby”, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
the Mother Goose rhymes that have much repetition,
can be used. During this stage the child loves little
anecdotes about babies, dogs, cats, mother, father.
In the “tell it again” stage from two to six the child
enjoys following a sequence of incidents and seeing the
pictures.</p>

<p>It is in the fourth or fifth year that his imagination
and store of mental pictures is sufficiently developed
so that he can make up stories of his own, and now his
imagination is not yet limited by an appreciation of
realities. This is the stage when fairy tales and myths
begin. Interest in nonsense syllables, long words,
rhyme, absurdity of statement, humorous situations,
is now ripening.</p>

<p>In the fifth and sixth year he is ready for fables,
and other animal tales such as those of the Jungle
Books, for stories of primitive life, for Hiawatha told
in Longfellow’s original version.</p>

<p>In the sixth and seventh year his horizon is widening
beyond his own immediate home and times. He is
ready for little stories about children or grown-ups
of other countries and times, for historical incidents,
great adventures. Children can now begin to follow
the continued story, and this is excellent training in
concentration; or they can be told the beginnings of a
story, and the situation left as a problem for their own
imagination to work upon.</p>

<p>The stories that the child himself tells are always a
clue both to his interest and his mental development.
The story he can tell will represent a simpler stage in
development than the story he can appreciate and
absorb.</p>

<p><b>Where to Find Stories.</b> Mother Goose is the true
classic of the nursery. It must be wisely selected,
however, for children. There is much that is crude,
and rude, as in all folk tales, and this should be culled
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>Fairy tales and fables also need to be carefully
selected. Andersen’s are ideal, allegorical, true.
Grimm’s and Abbott’s are collections of German and
English folklore. They, too, need careful selection.
Many of them reflect the undemocratic conditions of
an older form of government—the cruelty of the
autocrat, the superficial superiority of wealth and
station, the resentment of the oppressed. Felix
Adler points out that Æsop’s Fables reflect this
resentment of the oppressed against the oppressor,
and the trickery of the former to match the power
of the latter.</p>

<p>The great world myths, both of the Greeks and the
Anglo-Saxons, should become the early heritage of
every child. Simple incidents from the Iliad and
Odyssey, from Greek and Norse mythology, from
the Siegfried stories, Beowulf, the legends of King
Arthur, can be told during the fifth and sixth year,
thus giving a first speaking acquaintance with these
epics.</p>

<p>The following list is suggestive of types adapted to
each age; it does not attempt to be exhaustive. There
is so much of the classic and permanently good, far
more than any one child could possibly absorb, that
it is a double loss to the child if he is given the trashy
and mediocre. The ambitious parent needs to take
care that the child has time to think over, feel vividly,
see clearly, the tales he is told, and that too much is
not given in one year.</p>

<p><b>Cultivating a Scientific Mind.</b> Science is concerned
with causes and effects, laws and principles of action,
systematic classification of facts, exact knowledge of
facts. A scientific habit of mind is developed in the
little child by encouraging curiosity, exploration, experimenting,
collecting, questioning; by consistent parental
action and discipline, honesty and sincerity in
statements, the answering of questions so as to provoke
further thought.</p>

<p>Usually a child needs little stimulus to interest in
natural science. Everything in the world is new
to him. The baby is interested in every object he
can touch, in shining or moving objects. The toddler
is interested in moving things, especially animals,
trains, clocks; in sticks, stones, and leaves because he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
can use them. The little child from three to six is
interested in sun, moon, and stars, in day and darkness,
in rain, snow, wind, in flowers and trees, as well as in
animals and birds. Natural, spontaneous questions
regarding the biological origin and development of
life are asked between three and eight, and this is the
period especially recommended for teaching the child
of the mother’s part in his prenatal care, and the value
of the father’s share, and thereby fostering his wholesome
attitude of gratitude, and his respect for all
motherhood and fatherhood. At four or five, rivers,
lakes, hills, valleys, the time of day, attract his attention.
Processes of mechanics, filling and emptying,
pouring, pulleys, wheels, are matters of keen interest
from early in his second year.</p>

<p>There is an early stage when he asks “What?”
meaning what is its name. Later comes the “Why?”
which is a search for physical causes and reasons, and
also for philosophical reasons.</p>

<p><b>Learning the Fundamental Facts.</b> The teacher of
the very little child must first know what are the fundamental
facts in science. Too often the traditional
school training has given an intensive acquaintance
with one or two sciences, so detailed that the fundamental
foundations are obscured. The teacher of
the very little child needs, instead, a comprehensive
knowledge of many sciences, in their broad basic outlines,—especially
physics, chemistry, nature-study,
biology, physical geography, geology, astronomy, industrial
geography and industrial processes, the story
of primitive life and industries.</p>

<p><b>Nature Study That is Worth While.</b> Moreover, her
knowledge should not be purely impersonal; it must
be human, poetic, related to industry and religion.
The sense of wonder and of nurture is strong in the
little child. He is more interested in feeding and
caring for his rabbits or goldfish or flowers than in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
analyzing them, or describing their form or color; the
latter are merely incidental in his interest, and they
should be in his teaching. On the other hand, his
knowledge of form, color, and such abstract qualities
may well come quite naturally and incidentally through
nature-study and handwork rather than through special
apparatus, separated from real objects and life.</p>

<p><b>Geography.</b> This comes naturally through his personal
experiences. Maps, diagrams, globes, are complex
and abstract and symbolic; they belong somewhere
after six years, with most children not before nine
years. The child must have arrived at the stage
when he can think in terms of symbols, before he can
really interpret them. It will do no harm to have a
globe where he may see it, but it would be a fallacy
to consider that he can really interpret it, and a mistake
to attempt using it until he has grasped the idea
of the bigness of the earth on which he lives. Maps
will not be interpretable until later. He may point
to places on the map, but without appreciation of their
meaning. Somewhere between six and ten years of
age he may begin making a “map” of the imaginary
country he has built in the sand box, with rivers,
lakes, cities; or of the room, locating the articles of
furniture; or of the street, locating the houses, sidewalks,
telegraph poles, first drawing freehand, and
when more advanced, drawing to scale. At three or
four years, with his sand pile, he can reproduce forms
he has seen—hills, valleys, rivers, lakes. He will
want to use real water for rivers. It is well to let him
experiment with this until he is dissatisfied because of
its disappearance, and then look for play substitutes,—gray,
blue, or green yarn, paper or cloth, mica.
It is more important that it should be representative
to <em>him</em> than to his elders.</p>

<p>Real geography comes through seeing places and
people. The little child under five or six belongs naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
in the country, where he has the opportunity for
acquaintance with physical geography in many forms.
Great variety of natural objects and experiences
should be provided. On the other hand, intensive
acquaintance with only a few people or nationalities is
better. After four or five years of age, he is able to
stand the excitement of traveling, and the risk of dust
and crowds, and he is ready to profit by seeing other
people, cities, customs, ways of traveling, industries.
The least journey to a new environment is valuable,
to enlarge his perspective and his sympathies. Even
at three or four he likes to see pictures of other children
in other countries, and how they live,—their houses,
clothes, food, toys, pets. Especially is he attracted
by stories of primitive, outdoor life. The story of
Hiawatha, in Longfellow’s original, is well adapted
to the sixth year, and some children love it and enjoy
it earlier.</p>

<p>Dolls may be dressed to represent children of different
lands. The sand box may be used to represent
tropical, arctic, mountainous, agricultural, fishing,
mining countries and scenes. Scrapbooks can be
made for each country, with pictures from magazines,
railroad or steamship folders, post cards. Foreign
magazines may be obtained, in the east, through
Brentano’s (New York). Correspondence could easily
be arranged with a child in some foreign country if
not through personal acquaintances, at least through
some foreign school, mission, society, or consul. Early
acquaintance with the children of other countries cultivates
a feeling of sympathy that is the foundation
of world fellowship and international peace. If there
is opportunity to learn a few colloquial sentences in
some of these languages, this will still further deepen
the child’s sympathy. After six years, when his
interest in collecting is strong, foreign stamps, flags,
emblems, flowers, pictures, will be as keenly interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
to him as cigar labels or other inconsequential but
glittering objects.</p>

<p><b>Industries.</b> Let him see as many as possible of
the forms of industry, especially the primitive simple
forms, such as gardening, farming, care of animals,
horse-shoeing, baking, sewing. He should go often
to the grocery store (not during the busy hours) to
see the different kinds of foods. Better yet, he should
see some of these vegetables and fruits growing, the
wheat and corn standing in the fields. He should
see the ploughing, planting, weeding, harvesting; the
feeding and the milking of the cow; the hauling and
preparation of fuels. Little comment is necessary
beyond remarking how everything that we eat or wear
has come to us because other people have worked hard
to make it grow, or to bring it or prepare it for us, and
therefore we owe our thanks to all who have worked
for our comfort. Thus from his own experience he
may know and appreciate the postman who brings
the letters, the fireman who hurries to put out the fire,
the policeman who helps us across the crowded street
and watches night and day to keep us protected from
harm and danger, the street-sweeper and sprinkler
who keep the streets clean, the man who brings the
coal or wood or groceries, the street-car conductor and
motorman, the engineer and fireman on the train that
takes us about the country or brings the freight.</p>

<p>Through gratitude for the hard work that others do
for him he will also learn to respect all labor, even though
it does cause dirty hands and faces and clothes, and he
will naturally infer that it is his duty to do his share
and to work also for others.</p>

<p><b>History.</b> Children, like savages, are historically nearsighted;
they have not yet the experience to appreciate
historic time; every event is located near the present,
and their interest in history is more or less fictitious
and artificial. This is the period for the great myths,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
for imagination now exceeds experience, and any adventure
is credible.</p>

<p>There comes a time, about six years of age, when children
begin to ask for a “true” story, meaning a realistic
story, historically true. Then is the opportunity
to recount the experiences of mothers and children, as
well as of brothers and fathers, in other times. Nor
need these be limited to his own country or modern
times. “Once upon a time” or “A long, long time
ago” is somewhere back in a vague sometime; yesterday
or a million years ago are not yet spaced in his
mind. This sense of time-duration may be developed
by calling attention to it in his experience, for the two-year-old,
day and night; in the fourth year, morning
and afternoon, yesterday, to-day and to-morrow, seasons;
in the fifth year, the days of the week and the
months of the year will begin to have significance and
sequence; in the sixth year, “last Christmas”, “next
Fourth of July”, the date of this year, and the marking
of duration, under various circumstances, of a minute,
an hour, a day.</p>

<p>Of course, the little child will not be able to distinguish
between different nations or races of the past;
it is all one to him. This fact is easily overlooked by
the eager teacher, who has so long since classified
historic data in her own mind. This historical appreciation
does not develop until the early teens.</p>

<p>For these reasons, it is good pedagogy to let the
first historical stories be of the country in which the
child lives. Historic sequence in the telling of these
anecdotes is of slight importance.</p>

<p>Since so much of written history has hitherto been
military and political, it is easy to fall into the error
of telling stories of military experiences, especially
wars and battles. In the light of modern developments,
the superficialness and, for the child, the misleading
effect of the usual military story should be clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
evident. It should not be made the ideal, nor a substitute
for the adventure, courage, heroism, which the
child craves and admires. The teacher’s responsibility
is to find historic tales of those who served their fellowmen
by constructive bravery and venture,—life-saving,
exploring, inventing. Even a simple, homely incident
in the life of a noteworthy historical character will be
an introduction to deeper acquaintance later. In
American history, Columbus, the Pilgrims, William
Penn, Benjamin Franklin, Betsy Ross, Eli Whitney,
Edison, are a few examples. Stories from English history
easily relate themselves to the little child’s vision.
The childhood of noteworthy men and women furnishes
many stories for this age period.</p>

<p>The teacher needs to beware of the fallacy of reading
to children or telling to them things which they can
learn through their own experience, experimenting,
or observation. Many informational books of this
kind are at hand, both in science and history. The
temptation often is strong, especially for the teacher
who is eager that the child shall learn much, and who
has not clearly distinguished between mere erudition,
encyclopedic accumulation of facts and, on the other
hand, the vital, living experiences of life, with the growing
power to observe, interpret, and enjoy for one’s
self. The latter is dynamic, the way of wisdom.</p>

<p>Where museums or historical collections are available,
there is a great educational opportunity, although
much of the material is dead and unrelated to its
natural situation.</p>

<p><b>Mathematics.</b> The elements of arithmetic and
geometry have but a slight place in the life or interest
of the little child. At five or six he may begin to count
objects, but his capacity is limited. The mere memorizing
of numbers, as a series of words, is of no more
mathematical significance than a nonsense jingle, and
is not to be encouraged until, through his interest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
counting, the child has an appreciation of the concrete
meaning of numbers, at least to the range of ten or
twelve. Measuring, using the actual standard measures
of foot, yard, pound, pint, quart, gallon, dozen,
is usually of interest at six or seven years. Interest
in geometric forms is naturally slight, and even this
is doubtless an æsthetic, not a mathematical, interest.
Teaching of geometric form is easily overdone.</p>

<p><b>Reading and Writing.</b> These have no place, biologically,
before six years, and some psychologists say
they belong psychologically after eight years, in the
period of interest in symbols, abstractions, and rote
learning. It is known that normal children who enter
school at nine years usually finish the grades with
those of their own age who started three years earlier.
It is evident that with a natural outdoor environment,
the child will acquire a better physique, a larger acquaintance
with realities, and a richer development of
invention, initiative, self-expression, than he does in the
schoolroom. The ancient Greeks taught only games,
dancing, and music to children under nine. Doctor
G. Stanley Hall, Professor Lightner Witmer, Professor
Arthur Holmes, Professor Clifton E. Hodge are among
the authorities advising such late introduction to the
use of abstract symbols. What can be done educationally
in that period from six to nine years, without
teaching the three R’s, has been amply demonstrated
by Mrs. Marietta Johnson in her school at Fairhope,
Alabama, and at The Little School in the Woods at
Greenwich, Connecticut.</p>

<span class="fs80">HANDWORK</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“No line of culture is complete until it issues in motor habits
and makes a well-knit soul texture that admits concentration
series in many directions and that can bring all its resources to
bear on any point.</p>

<p>“Fully assimilated knowledge that becomes a part of life is
strength—but that which is undigested and not transformed
into carrying power, but is a burden to be carried in memory, is
an added cause of tension and fatigue.”</p>

<p class="right">
—<span class="smcap">G. Stanley Hall.</span><br>
</p>
</div>


<p>Three fundamental principles are to be noted:</p>

<p>1. All is grist that comes to the mill of the handworker.</p>

<p>2. The one element that will transform any object
or combination of objects into a created product is
imagination.</p>

<p>3. The purpose in the children’s handwork is not
the production of finished products, but creative self-activity,
invention, self-reliance, the making of things
to use, the utilizing of materials found in the environment,
the putting of ideas into concrete form, the
acquisition of dexterity with the hands, the development
of brain centers through use of the hands.</p>

<p>The nursery, playroom or yard should have a corner
for tools and materials adapted to the muscles of small
hands and arms. A workbench of a height adapted to
the child at each stage of his development, can be
purchased at the large hardware stores, or can be made
from a heavy packing box. Tools should be kept in
good condition, and materials neatly shelved. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
child at two years can begin to keep his workshop in
good order.</p>

<p><b>Forms of handwork.</b> The suggested list begins with
the simpler forms and continues to the more difficult,
in each group.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Painting: using a house-painter’s brush for real or

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Whitewood, ¼ inch, in assorted widths and lengths</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Brass paper fasteners</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Paint boxes should contain only the three primary
colors (red, yellow, blue) and black, so the child can
learn to mix his own colors.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Labeled boxes for materials should be kept on the play
shelves, and scraps of everything usable from the
household kept in these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Dry clay powder is the cheapest form of modeling
material; composition clay or plasticine are cleaner.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Plaster of Paris and Portland cement are easy material
for children to work with. They should be mixed with
lukewarm water until the consistency of thick cream.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Dry colors purchased at the paint shop may be mixed
with the dry clay powder, plaster of Paris, or cement,
for color effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Children who live in the vicinity of a pottery can have
their clay pieces fired. Enamel paint or water glass
will waterproof clay. Decorations may be made with
water colors or shellac varnish mixed with dry colors.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Handwork that is Injurious.</b> The fine muscles of
the fingers and eyes are undeveloped in the child under
six years, and the nervous system is easily fatigued or
overstrained. Handwork that involves use of small
objects, as toothpicks, straws, lentils, peas, tiny beads,
cambric needles, thread, 1-inch blocks, small papers,
is a nervous strain upon the child. Fine lines, dots,
holes, the following of a fine line in cutting or coloring,
are also injurious to the eyes. Such fine material and
work is no longer used in kindergartens that have
respect for child hygiene.</p>

<p>Too long seated application to work at a table is
also injurious. Half an hour is long enough for any
child under nine years to sit still at work. If he is
voluntarily absorbed longer, some active diversion
should be arranged for a quarter hour, at least.</p>

<p>Work suggested that is too difficult for the child to
do alone either discourages him by its impossibility,
or develops dependence upon others.</p>

<p><b>Educational Values.</b> The handwork is, educationally,
a means of giving concrete expression to imaginative
ideas, and of making the experience of the child
more vivid. Stories, scenes from history, records of
the child’s own experience, can be portrayed. The
child does not naturally copy literally from objects.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_320_fp" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_320_fp.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>No effort should be made, before six years, to
produce finished products. Technique or skill in
production do not belong to this period. Vividness,
self-expression, development of motor control of arms
and hands, coördination of eye and hand, the joy of
workmanship, the confidence in creating,—these are
the purposes of handwork in early childhood.</p>

<p>The genetic method in handwork is to start with
your idea of what you want to make, and then make it
of such material as you can find. This is Nature’s
process, the child’s process, of creating.</p>

<p>The list of ideas to be realized will fall into a few
groups:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
Dolls in great variety<br>
Animals<br>
Trains<br>
Wagons and other vehicles<br>
Boats<br>
Houses, animal cages, churches, barns, stores<br>
Doll clothes<br>
Furniture<br>
Dishes<br>
Toys for store-keeping—all lines of merchandise<br>
Toys for playing at occupation—all lines of industry<br>
Games<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>If any genius is involved in handwork, it is in adapting
any kind of material to the realization of any one
of these ideas.</p>


<p><b>Dolls.</b> Clothespins with cloth or paper tied on are
about the simplest.</p>

<p>Corncobs, with “real” silk hair, clothes of corn husks
or cloth make popular dolls. Arms may be made of
cloth bags stuffed with paper, cotton, cloth, and sewed
into the shoulder seam of the dress.</p>

<p>Rag dolls stuffed with cloth, the features and fingers
marked in with ink or water color. Any one can cut
a rag doll pattern from muslin. (For sanitary reasons,
rag dolls are not so popular as they used to be.)</p>

<p>Nut dolls. Peanut dolls are made by using double
nuts, sewed together to make the head, arms, legs and
body; the features and hair marked with ink. Almond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
hickory, hazel and walnut heads are used, attached
to sticks or rag bodies. Corks, clay pipes, bone
buttons, raffia, yarn, may be used for doll heads with
these bodies.</p>

<p>Vegetable dolls. Carrots, potatoes, cucumbers,
squashes may be used, and the features marked with
ink or knife.</p>

<p>The temporary possibility of vegetable, nut, and
other “stunt” dolls does not add to their popularity.
They are of interest chiefly after nine years, when the
doll interest is waning.</p>

<p>Paper dolls. Bodies made of stiff paper or pasteboard,
with clothes that can be taken off and put on. Faces
can be drawn with ink or water colors, or heads from
pictures may be pasted on.</p>

<p>Such paper dolls must be of a size to handle with ease.</p>

<p>Paper dolls cut singly or in chains, by folding paper
and cutting, are a source of amusement to children
about five, and of creative enjoyment about eight,
when there is the motor ability and imagination to
create them in great variety.</p>

<p><b>Animals and Birds.</b> Vegetable. Use large vegetables
for body; twigs or toothpicks for legs; straw,
string, yarn, for tails; pins, beads, buttons, cloves,
currants, raisins, for eyes; leaves, paper, cloth, for
nose and ears; gashes for mouth.</p>

<p>Paper. Cut out freehand, or from heavy outline, in
newspaper, drawing paper, wrapping paper.</p>

<p>Pasteboard. Cut with strong scissors or with coping
saw. These may have legs, heads, and tails made
separately and attached with thread, string, or fine
wire so they will move.</p>

<p>Wooden. Draw from paper designs, cut from whitewood
or other soft wood, with coping saw. These, too,
may have movable limbs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Kindergarten supply houses publish a set of paper
patterns for animals and one for birds.</p>

<p>Animals and birds may be colored with water colors.
Or wooden ones may be painted “true to life”, using<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
the shellac and colors; about three coats are required.
They are then waterproof, and the colors will not run.
A paper or pasteboard support can be fastened to the
back side of animals so they will stand up. Birds
may be hung by a thread from the ceiling or window
frame.</p>

<p>Boys who can whittle can carve out animals, thus
providing some with three dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Houses.</b> Houses are easily made from boxes by
cutting out or drawing on doors and windows, with
slanting or flat roofs of pasteboard or corrugated board.
Porches, lean-tos, extensions, chimneys, steeples, gables,
can be added by gluing or sewing on additional pasteboard.
Castles, forts, silos, water towers are made
from round boxes. Houses may be decorated with
water colors.</p>

<p>Animal and menagerie cages are made by cutting
out strips from one side of a box. Staircases are made
of folded paper or bristol board.</p>

<p>Paper houses can be made from stiff paper, with doors
and windows drawn or cut out. These are easily made,
and a source of amusement for a rainy day, but not
highly valued because not enduring.</p>

<p>Wooden houses are the joy of childhood. A house
small enough to be convenient indoors, or large
enough to play in outdoors, is one of the chief rights
of childhood. For children under six or seven years, a
packing box can be used. Two boxes of the same size
make a two-story house. The children can scrub,
sandpaper, paint, the outside and floors, design or saw
out windows, put in partitions to divide into separate
rooms, add a slanting roof and chimney. Doors may
be added with hinges. Bricks may be made of clay
and fastened together with cement or glue for a tiny
brick house. Staircases are made of strips or blocks of
the wood.</p>

<p>Children over seven can build a real wooden house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
with a little suggestion. They are also able to make
small cement blocks for a block house. Boys of ten or
twelve can make a log hut.</p>

<p><b>Trains, Wagons, Boats, Vehicles.</b> Pasteboard vehicles
can be made from spool boxes, candy boxes,
match boxes. For wheels use spools, round wooden
buttons, round box covers, milk bottle covers, circles
cut from pasteboard. For axles use skewers, toothpicks,
nails. Axles and wheels may be tacked, sewed, or
pasted to the wagon. Axles may be dispensed with,
and the wheels pasted directly to the wagon box.
Dashboards, seats, canopies, foot rests, smokestacks,
cowcatchers of paper or pasteboard can be pasted on,
or attached with brass paper fasteners.</p>

<p>Paper wagons and cars can be made from a paper
square folded into sixteen small squares, the sides and
ends turned up and pasted, and paper circles pasted
on for wheels. Paper seats and canopies can be added.
The proportions can be changed by cutting out some
of the squares.</p>

<p>Wooden vehicles are most satisfactory, because they
can be made to really go, and boats can be sailed,—which
is a boat’s very reason for existing.</p>

<p>For wagons or cars, a soap box or starch box is
very satisfactory. The axles should be securely nailed
on, absolutely straight. Material for axles and wheels
will depend upon the size of the wagon and degree of
efficiency desired. For small, crude vehicles, large
wooden button molds, wooden spools (possibly sawed
in half) may be utilized for wheels, and toothpicks,
kindergarten sticks, or twigs for axles. A small nail or
small circle of pasteboard, wax, or plasticine slipped on to
the axle, each side of the wheel, will keep the latter
in place. For more efficient and finished work, wooden
disks of a suitable size and with the hole bored through,
and the round sticks of a size to fit them, may be purchased
from the carpenter shop or planing mill. Or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
the holes may be bored with the gimlet and filed out to
size. The axles are glued into the disks, then glued,
nailed, or screwed to the wagon or car body, and the
edges filed or sandpapered so the wheels will turn. Or
the disks may be nailed at the end of the axle, using
a heavy nail with large head. For nicer work, regular
wheels and axles may be purchased at the hardware
store.</p>

<p>The engine smokestack is made from an empty
spool or round box glued on. The cars are coupled
together with string, wire, rope, or tiny chains purchased
at the hardware store.</p>

<p>The simplest boat is merely a raft with a string tacked
on, a spool smokestack, or a sail of paper on a wooden
toothpick or skewer, tacked on one end or put into a
nail hole. Beyond this is the two or three-decked boat
made by fastening small wooden fig boxes or cigar
boxes to the four pillars made from slats of a fruit
crate, the first deck tacked to a thick block of wood for
a keel. This boat will carry real cargoes.</p>

<p>A raft, either doll size or real size, of half-inch board
nailed to two parallel joists, can be made by the six-year-old.
With the coping saw, a sailboat deck with
pointed ends can be made from the whitewood, a
block nailed beneath for keel, a sailcloth of muslin
hemmed and fastened with cord or small rope to a
mast that fits into the hole bored by the gimlet.</p>

<p>Any number of tiny boats may be made of corks,
nutshells, eggshells, with sails of paper and cloth,
masts and oars of toothpicks, skewers or twigs, seats
of paper or pasteboard.</p>

<p>Rafts may be made of sticks, corncobs, or strips of
bark bound together with raffia, grasses, or cord. A
canoe may be made of birch bark or leather sewed
together at the ends, and lined with oiled paper, rubber
cloth or oilcloth to make it water-tight. This will
carry dolls and cargo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p><b>Furniture.</b> This can be made by the wholesale.</p>

<p>Paper. The easiest way is to use the paper square,
folded into sixteen squares, folding and cutting away
to get the desired proportions. Paper circles are used
for wheels, rockers, mirrors, stove lids; silver paper
for mirrors; gilt paper for brass ornaments. Water
color gives realistic touches.</p>

<p>Pasteboard. Sheet bristol board may be used, first
drawing the design carefully, providing for lapping,
folding along the marked lines, and pasting the laps.
In this way any desired size can be had. The designs
can first be made in paper.</p>

<p>Pasteboard boxes require less work. Spools may be
glued to a box cover as legs for a table or chair. Small
spools for legs, or pasteboard semicircles fastened on
for rockers, transform a box into a cradle. Safety
match boxes glued on top of each other, with a paper
fastener or button attached as a knob to the sliding
sections, make a tiny chiffonier; a pasteboard frame
attached to the back has a silver paper mirror or even
one of the tiny real glass pocket mirrors. Beds may be
made by fastening a pasteboard strip for head and foot
board to the ends of a shallow oblong box. A poster
bed is made from an oblong box and cover, sticking four
skewers at the corners for legs and posts.</p>

<p>Crude wooden furniture can be made from soft
blocks of wood fastened together with small wire
nails. Chairs are made by nailing a back strip to a
block seat; tables by nailing a square or round top to
a center block or to blocks at each corner for legs.</p>

<p>Grocery boxes, shoe boxes, cigar boxes, fruit crates,
will furnish cheap material of pine wood. This, however,
splits easily, has knotholes and splinters, and is
a last resort. An assortment of whitewood, one-half
inch thick, in one, two, three and four-inch width
strips, will be much more satisfactory. Patterns and
dimensions should first be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p><b>Dishes.</b> Nutshells, sea shells, acorn cups, leaves,
gourds, chips, corn husks, pea pods, milkweed pods,
eggshells, hollowed out apples, potatoes, squashes are
the merest suggestion of the natural dishes suitable to
a primitive and child life society.</p>

<p>Modeling clay or plasticine are the most satisfactory
materials for dishes. Many dishes and utensils can be
cut freehand in outline from Manila or silver paper,
tin foil, bristol board. Children at nine or ten can
work in hammered brass and bent iron.</p>

<p><b>Games.</b> Ringtoss. Glue a small, straight stick, as
a piece of a broom handle, upright to a flat board or
disk. Make rings of several sizes from willow or other
flexible branches, tied with raffia or cord; or use embroidery
hoops, or rims from cheese boxes, hat boxes,
small kegs. Any of these may be wound with raffia,
strips of colored cloth, or ribbon.</p>

<p>Faba Gaba. Make bean bags of different sizes.
Make a frame by nailing four strips together and nailing
two strips across this square to divide it into four holes.
This may be varied by (a) making the holes of uneven
dimensions; (b) making a larger frame and dividing
into six or nine even or uneven dimensions; (c) making
three or four concentric or contiguous circles.</p>

<p>Grace Hoops. Make hoops as for ringtoss, about
twelve inches in diameter. Make sticks about two
feet long, half-inch diameter, of straight young
branches, old toy brooms, old curtain rods; or buy
them at the carpenter shop. Rings and sticks may
be wound as in ringtoss.</p>

<p>Colored balls. Crochet covers of colored string or
embroidery silk for rubber balls, or sew segments of
colored linen or silk together for cover. Select carefully
a series of true prismatic colors,—red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, violet. Attach a string of the
braided cord, silk or fabric. These are washable and
more sanitary than the worsted balls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p><b>Toys.</b> Mechanical toys <em>that children make themselves</em>
are of educational value, as well as interest. In making
their own mechanical toys the children learn the significance
of many principles in physics, and are able
to apply these in a variety of ways. Some children
will thus discover principles for themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<span class="fs80">MUSIC AND ART</span></h2>
</div>


<p><b>Rhythm and Musical Sound.</b> Even the tiny baby
responds to rhythm and to melody. Rhythm brings
“a cadence to the soul”, to use G. Stanley Hall’s
phrase; it relaxes and soothes both mind and body;
it has far-reaching significance as a spiritual and moral
force. Chanting any rhythmic poem or jingles, singing,
rhythmic performing of physical exercises, are the
beginnings of music as a rhythmic art. When the
noise-enjoying age arrives, at about six months, a
string of soft-toned, musical sleigh bells, or later in
the first year, at the pounding stage, a tubephone, will
give as much enjoyment as harsh noises; and at the
same time these are cultivating a rudimentary musical
sense. With the development of the phonograph,
good music can be had even in households where no one
plays a musical instrument. A baby of six months
will notice the music, and most children from a year
old will show enjoyment in hearing it. It is less
important to acquaint little children with well-known
classics—which are easily thus worn stale—than it
is to provide good types of melody, harmony, and
rhythm,—music that is sincere, enduring, normal.
If children hear much of such music from the great
masters and their disciples, before the age of ten, their
tastes may be permanently influenced, and cheap,
flashy, sensational music will fail to attract them.</p>

<p>As rapidly as a child develops motor ability to use
them, musical instruments of good tone, adapted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
his size, will provide him with enjoyable toys that at
the same time cultivate sense of good musical sound
and opportunity for musical experimenting and self-expression.
A stout drum, cymbals, triangle, a tambourine,
flute (being careful of its use by only one
individual, and that it is wiped before using) are inexpensive.
Montessori uses musical glasses and a
series of bells tuned to scale and sounded by striking
them. Kindergartners make wind harps by stringing
mandolin or other cheap strings and wires on a wooden
frame made in the workshop. This may be tuned for
chords and hung where the wind will play fairy music
upon it.</p>

<p>Every little child loves to play upon the piano. The
ordinary toy piano is a jangle of noises that can only
pervert the child’s sense of musical sound. Good toy
pianos, with about two scales, small enough for the
three-year-old size, can be purchased for a moderate
price from some large musical stores. If circumstances
will at all permit a child to play at his own sweet will
and in his own way upon a real piano, the act will not
only yield him indescribable bliss, but will foster immeasurably
his love of music, and provide a means of
musical self-expression. Few people expect to become
great artists on any instrument. Technique, therefore,
is of minor importance. The love of music, the
desire to find expression through music, is the important
feature to cultivate, leaving technique to a later age,
nearer the teens.</p>

<p>The hearing of singing as a daily experience of early
childhood, is potent for imitation and for good humor.
A baby who hears much singing or humming will,
even in his first year, attempt to hum, and in his second
year, make up little snatches of song. This is music
as it should be, developing out of the daily experience
of life, illuminating that experience. Froebel urged
his teachers to encourage this spontaneous, natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
singing, and to set the example by their own spontaneous
singing when with the children. In progressive
schools of to-day, children of all ages are encouraged to
compose melodies for nursery rhymes or little poems
that they know, and later to develop harmonies. Thus
through creation the child develops a richer self-expression,
and if he is interested to become more proficient,
he furnishes his own incentive for the drudgery
of acquiring technique. What more pathetic situation
than that of a child compelled to “practice”, whose
soul is in revolt, and who every moment is acquiring
a deeper loathing for music?</p>

<p>For teaching musical notation, there is a pasteboard
keyboard, a set of pasteboard notes of different time-length
and a special blackboard with the musical lines
on which the notes can be hung. With these many
games can be played, even at five or six years of age
with some children, although others will not be ready
until seven or eight.</p>

<p><b>The Crude Tastes of Childhood.</b> Little children, like
savages, have not developed fine discriminations in
color. This is largely a matter of education. The
little child shows a preference for vivid color, and no
sense of harmony in color. His color sense is as undeveloped
as his spoken language, and needs training,
especially through good examples, for its refinement. A
glass prism hung in the sunlight will give him pure
spectrum hues while delighting even his baby days. It
is not yet known with certainty at what age children’s
eyes are sufficiently developed to really perceive color,
although they are evidently able to distinguish degrees
of brightness before a year of age, and show a preference
for red or yellow objects rather than gray. They
prefer colored pictures to black and white. Kindergarten
supply houses now furnish large colored wooden
beads, to be strung on shoe laces, and colored papers in
graduated series of hues, and large colored wax crayons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
the size of a marking pencil. The Montessori apparatus
now includes a set of flat wooden bobbins, about two
by three inches square, painted in graduated shades of
the spectrum colors, which the children at four and five
years love to match or arrange by graduations of shade.
A box of water colors (primary colors only) is indispensable
to childhood.</p>

<p><b>Art Education.</b> Good pictures, well colored, with
sufficient vividness to interest the child, abound in the
magazines and the shops. The classic nursery rhymes
and tales have been illustrated in color by several eminent
artists, and copies may be secured through any
kindergarten supply house. The little child prefers
pictures of animals, children, and mothers with children,
realistic or homelike. He is rarely interested in
still life, the classic, or the symbolic.</p>

<p>The ambitious teacher can easily overdo the matter
of taking children to an art museum. An occasional
trip, between five and nine years of age, will do no
harm, if they are permitted to wander at their will.
It starts the habit of going to a museum. Of greater
potency for æsthetic training is the beauty and harmony
of the child’s own home, and especially of his
own room. Here inexpensive but beautiful colored
pictures hung low enough for him to see them easily,
and charming little plaster casts, will feed his mind and
his soul, as does the daily singing. He is learning that
art is for the daily life, not merely for unusual places
and occasions as in the museum.</p>

<p>At five or six years of age children may begin to make
scrapbooks of beautiful and charming pictures that
they find in magazines, or that are purchased through
the kindergarten or art stores. Postcard reproductions
in color are obtainable of many famous pictures, both
classic and nursery subjects.</p>

<p>In art, as in morals, the constructively good will naturally
crowd out the crude, the vicious, and the mediocre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p><b>Children’s Drawings and Painting.</b> To quote from
Doctor G. Stanley Hall:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Children often like to look at and more or less understand
pictures early in the second year. They care
most for those that have a story connected with them,
and want their pictures read. Children like to draw illustrations
of stories and concrete things, which must not
be taken away from them in order that they may be precociously
taught to see lines only. Instead, therefore, of
current methods, the thing for kindergarten and lower
grades to draw is the human figure, and vastly more freedom
and individuality are needed. Geometrical lines
are ghostly and wooden. Things in motion are more
interesting, and perhaps Ruskin is right in saying that
the child should be limited to the voluntary practice of
art. The prevailing methods that begin with mathematical
forms, cube, cylinder, etc., are stultifying and
not only destroy the natural zest and ability to draw,
but take away the power to enjoy art and to understand
nature, geography, history, literature, which it
is one object of art to inculcate.</p>

<p>The child desires to draw human beings, generally
in action. Drawing teachers usually demand complete
visual control, but the children draw lines symbolizing
the direction birds fly, draw the wind, draw a zigzag line
representing the dance a person is engaged in, and
even gross errors are repeated after correction and
explanation, showing how dominant muscle habits
are. Young children draw anything with abandon and
pleasure. They do not use their eyes much, no matter
how difficult the theme, but draw their own image of
it with about as good success as if there were no model.
Children care nothing for accuracy here, which is the
ideal of the methodists. Their order below ten years
of age is the human figure, then animals, plants, or
houses, then mechanical inventions, geometrical designs
and ornaments. Children’s work is essentially
pictorial and not decorative. Thus Ricci declares that
art as such to children is unknown. Froebel is wrong,
therefore, and the child enters the educational field by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
the door of literature rather than by that of mathematics.</p>

<p>Always some one or, at most, a few details are focused
upon and magnified, betraying just what and how far
the child has observed up to date. If we only had a
complete collection of all the drawings of a single child
with proclivities for art but who had been unrepressed
by criticism or derision, we should find its very soul
in each developmental stage represented. Too early
insistence upon technique crushes. Teachers have so
long put form above content that they little suspect
the innate power and love of children for this kind of
work. Above all, teaching should be to encourage and
not to repress the tendency to exaggerate each new
trait, and should have regard not to the finished product
and should pay little attention to symmetry or
to an artistic whole. Uniformity, too, should be cast
to the winds and the teacher should encourage the deep
instinctive tendency of pupils to perfect each item as
it looms into the center of interest.</p>

<p>From several hundred drawings, with the name
given them by the child written by the teacher, the
chief difference inferred is in concentration. Some
make faint, hasty lines, representing all the furniture of
a room, or sky and stars, or all the objects they can
think of, while others concentrate upon a single object.
It is a girl with buttons, a house with a keyhole or
steps, a man with a pipe or heels or ring made grotesquely
prominent. The development of observation
and sense of form is best seen in the pictures of men.
The earliest and simplest representation is a round
head, two eyes, and legs. Later comes mouth, then
nose, then hair, then ears. Arms, like legs, at first,
grow directly from the head, rarely from the legs, and
are seldom fingerless, though sometimes it is doubtful
whether several arms, or fingers, from head and legs
without arms, are meant. Of 44 human heads only
9 are in profile. This is one of the many analogies with
the rock and cave drawings of primitive man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p><b>The Sunday Supplement.</b> Fortunate the child who is
protected from the encroachment of these execrations.
They are like the cheap colored candy in the penny
shops,—made to sell to those of undeveloped sensibilities,
and further dulling those sensibilities to better life.
The ordinary Sunday Supplement page for children is a
clever combination of all the crudities that children enjoy—vivid
color, crude drawing, bad manners, defiance
of authority, clownish humor. Of course children cry
for it, as they do for drugs that have dulled their nerves
and set up perverted tastes. If it is kept from the child
until his teens, and meanwhile his taste is being trained
by natural, daily means, the probabilities are that he will
then find it offensive; at least he will have passed the
age when it can pervert his taste and ideals.</p>

<p>The clownish humor, the crude drawing, the humor of
the unusual position and unexpected dilemma, without
the bad manners and other unethical conditions, are
furnished in abundance in the drawings of Leslie
Brooke, Gelett Burgess, Peter Newell, in Tenniel’s illustrations
of Alice’s Adventures, in Edward Lear’s Nonsense
Books, to mention only a few. Delicately colored
pictures, which adults find exquisite, do not attract the
child, but in this day there are abundant treasures of
pictures and picture books with colors strong, yet not
blatant. In this respect the English and American work
is in the main preferable to French, German, Russian.</p>

<p>Many books of songs for little children are published
that are merely mediocre, or ill-adapted to children
because not based on a knowledge of child psychology
and the range of the child’s voice. Some children
can carry a tune at three years, others not until six
or seven years. The natural range of the child’s
voice can be easily tested by trying it out with the
piano; it will usually range from E to A at three years
and from middle B to upper D at six years. These
physiological limitations indicate that songs for children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
to sing should have a simple melody, within this range,
and should be short. Children like simple hymns,
lullabies, songs about animals, nature, play, dolls, and
action songs.</p>

<p>If a child is thought to have vocal talent, the voice
should be especially protected from strain and misuse,
and intensive training postponed until late in the teens
when the voice has become placed. A teacher of ability
should be engaged for the first training.</p>

<p>All children should be trained to use the voice intelligently,
which is hygienically. They should be taught
to sing softly and naturally, and never allowed to sing
harshly, boisterously, or falsetto. Screaming and shouting
injure the voice, especially in childhood, while the
vocal cords are developing. By a little careful hygiene,
the example of musical, well-modulated voices in their
elders, and the selection of songs within their range,
American children might develop as pleasant voices as
are found in some of the countries across the sea.</p>

<p><b>General Principles.</b> Careful hygiene will reduce
illness to a minimum. Study what to do in emergencies
and illness before these appear, in order to be
mentally and technically prepared to act promptly,
with confidence and poise, when need arises. Teach
children as early as possible how to spit, gargle, raise
phlegm, inhale. Habits of obedience, self-control, and
regularity will assist in recovery. Under any circumstances
avoid excitement; keep calm and self-possessed.
Use firmness, gentleness, patience, good
cheer, and the spirit of play in care of illness. It is
wiser to call the doctor at first, when symptoms of
illness appear, than to incur severe sickness and greater
cost by delay. A severely sick child needs a trained
nurse. Children have less resistance than adults,
and succumb more easily, therefore they need prompt,
intelligent treatment.</p>

<p>Every woman who has the care of a little child should
learn the following from the physician or nurse: use of
clinical thermometer, bedpan, giving of enema, massage,
dressing and bathing of bed patient, bandaging, first
aid in serious cuts, fractures, broken limbs, drowning.
There should always be at least one room in the house
with washable walls, sunny exposure, and without carpets,
heavy draperies or upholstered furniture, that can
be used for an isolation sick room in emergency.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms of Illness and Their Immediate Care.</b>
When several symptoms are evident at once, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
matter is more urgent. It is usually advisable to
have the doctor call, rather than to expose the sick
child to the change of temperature, dust, excitement
of crowds, or danger of infecting others. In severe
injury, secure any medical assistance in quickest way.</p>

isolate and keep in bed for a day in a well-ventilated

<p>Communicable diseases may be conveyed by discharges,
especially from nose and mouth, and in breath;
also in vomitus, discharges from eyes and ears, feces,
urine, and blood. May be contagious several days before
serious symptoms appear in acute cases; and may
be carried in throat and mouth many months and conveyed
by persons showing no symptoms.</p>

<p><b>To Prevent Contagion.</b> (1) Avoid exposing the child
to any one who has a contagious disease. (2) Do not
take young children (under seven, at least) into crowds,
busy streets, city dust, or street cars. (3) Household
employees, especially child’s nurse, cook, kitchen
employee, or laundress, should be selected with regard
to their health; a thorough health examination for
the child’s caretaker, unless personally well known or
professionally trained, is the only safeguard. (4) No
one with a cold, sore throat or other symptoms of contagious
disease should be with a young child or prepare
its food. (5) Keep special handkerchiefs for each
child and never use any one else’s for it. (6) Teach
scrupulous individual use of cups, spoons, forks, wash
cloths, towels, handkerchiefs, whistles, and not to use
wash basin for brushing teeth. (7) Avoid pacifiers;
wipe toys daily. (8) Clean the child’s finger nails
daily, and always wash his hands before eating.
(9) Attendant should always wash hands before preparing
food, giving medicine, caring for eyes, nose,
mouth, or wounds; and after care of diapers, toilet,
wounds. (10) Milk and water supply should be carefully
guarded; unless assured pure, milk must be pasteurized,
water boiled. (11) Avoid cats or dogs for
young children’s pets.</p>

<p>Disease germs can thrive in the mucus, in some
tissues, or in the blood. They may enter (1) through
the nose, (2) the mouth, (3) a break in the skin. The
sick person may convey them (1) from the mouth, by
coughing, by a kiss, or on cups, spoons, forks, napkins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
towels; (2) in mucus from the nose, in sneezing, or
on handkerchiefs; in discharges from eyes or ears;
(3) in cases of intestinal infections, from intestinal
discharges; (4) venereal disease, from break in skin,
from open sore, from suppurating infected eyes;
(5) from discharge of boils; (6) scales from skin
probably only in smallpox or chicken-pox; (7) on
fingers. (8) Germs of contagious diseases are sometimes
carried in water, ice, milk, or dust. (9) Cats
and dogs easily carry disease germs.</p>

<p>Contagious diseases are always dangerous, causing
a large harvest of deaths and leaving lifelong defects
in many survivors. It is not necessary that children
should have any of them. Children should be carefully
protected from exposure to any disease. Good hygiene
raises vitality and increases the white blood corpuscles,
which are the special protectors against disease germs.</p>

<p>If a child has been exposed to dust or crowds, or if
contagious disease is prevalent, give a nasal douche
and gargle with normal salt solution, 4% boric solution,
or diluted listerine, before meals and at night. If
exposed to disease, also disinfect face, neck, hands,
clothes, shampoo the hair with tincture green soap,
isolate, notify doctor; repeat after quarantine.</p>

<p><b>Care of Illnesses Prevalent in Childhood.</b> <em>Anemia.</em>
Pallor, languor, loss of weight, poor appetite. Give
outdoor life, nutritious diet, cold baths, sun baths.
Needs medical examination for cause.</p>

<p><em>Boils.</em> Indicate low resistance. Applying hot
fomentations wet in boric solution may prevent coming
to head. If at head, apply hot fomentation five
minutes; lance with sterilized needle. After removing
contents, apply listerine, witch hazel or 25% alcohol,
on sterile gauze; anoint with zinc ointment, and
bandage to prevent re-infection. Poultices are unsanitary.
Pus is infectious; prevent its touching
skin, burn immediately, and sterilize needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<p><em>Chap.</em> Prevent by drying face and hands thoroughly
after washing. Apply camphor ice or cold
cream before taking outdoors, and at bedtime. Use
corn meal or oatmeal in place of soap.</p>

<p><em>Cold.</em> May be either a congestion or an infection.
In any case isolate and treat first symptoms at once;
give persistent care to cure quickly. Colds pave the
way for more serious infections. Give oil laxative for
one or two days. Apply few drops of glycerine, albolene,
or liquid vaseline in nose every two hours and at
bedtime. Use sterilized medicine dropper; warm oil
slightly by heating in dropper over boiling water. For
children over one year use nasal oil spray or nasal
douche with physician’s prescription. Give hot leg
bath or hot tub bath, wrapping well to produce slight
perspiration; rub with 25% alcohol solution few hours
later, or before rising, to close pores; keep well covered.
Keep in bed while fever continues. If in head and
eyes, apply cold cloth wet in weak boric or salt solution,
over eyes and nose, changing every five minutes,
in half-hour periods. Give all the water patient will
take, at hourly intervals, or lemonade for children over
eighteen months. For dry, parched mouth, rinse with
weak salt water, give weak lemonade, or cracker to
chew.</p>

<p>If accompanied by chills, keep in warm room, (68°)
well ventilated. If without chills, and when fever has
subsided, keep outdoors, well protected, but not dressed
warm enough to perspire. If in chest, apply counter-irritant
(adapted to age) to chest and back. If not
recovered in a day or two, notify physician. For repeated
colds, discover cause, improve hygiene; increase
resistance by cold morning bath, at least to chest and
back, and give cod-liver oil.</p>

<p><em>Colic.</em> Give no food during the attack. Give a teaspoon
of water (96° F.) with weak peppermint or soda
mint dissolved in one ounce water; repeat every five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
minutes. Upright position, with patting on back, will
relieve gas in stomach. For gas in intestine, massage
gently, beginning at lower left side, and working
backward along length of colon, always pressing
and stroking toward end of colon. If constipated,
or attack very severe, give warm enema (110° F.) with
soap or normal salt solution. Apply hot fomentations,
or hot stupe, made by thoroughly mixing twenty drops
of turpentine in one pint water, to abdomen; or hot
flannels or hot water bag, to abdomen, buttocks, and
thighs. Keep feet warm. Change fomentation or
stupe every ten minutes. When relieved, follow with
cool hand rub (80°). Constipation in nursing mother
will cause colic. Baby subject to colic should have
two or three daily movements. Give less at feeding,
with longer intervals, slower feeding.</p>

<p><em>Constipation.</em> Prevent and treat by diet, exercise,
and general hygiene. If these fail, have medical
examination for possible anatomical defect or obstruction.
For acute attack, give mineral oil, increase
water, give abdominal exercises at intervals during
day, gently knead abdomen, working along line of
colon from right to left. The use of enemas and suppositories
relaxes the intestinal wall, and induces a
chronic condition. Salts, castor oil, cascara, and
other drugs overstimulate intestinal secretions, irritate
lining, and require continued, increasing use.
Calomel may remain in system and cause serious illness;
it should never be given to children. If necessary to
use any special measures, adapt laxative from list
(page 362). For chronic cases in older children, apply
cold compress around abdomen at night until condition
is improved.</p>

<p><em>Convulsions.</em> Give leg or tub bath at 98° F. for ten
minutes; mustard may be added. Be very careful
that water is not too hot. Child may be put in with
clothing on. Put cold cloth around neck and on head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
Give prompt laxative and an emetic. Keep child in
bed till recovered from shock.</p>

<p><em>Cramp in Intestines.</em> Treat as colic.</p>

<p><em>Croup.</em> Apply hot fomentation to chest for ten minutes,
followed by cold compress. Give salt water
emetic to cause vomiting and remove phlegm, if breathing
is still difficult. If necessary, in severe case, give
half teaspoon of syrup of ipecac to produce vomiting;
apply counter-irritant to chest and back. Keep child
well wrapped. If severe, prepare kettle of boiling
water so child can inhale steam. Add two tablespoonfuls
of compound tincture of benzoin, creosote or oil
eucalyptus, or teaspoon of vinegar or ammonia. Use
light blanket to cover kettle and head of child. See
that kettle is not near enough to burn face. Be careful
that child does not choke, and that clothing is not
dampened. Wrap a piece of rubber sheeting or woolen
blanket about shoulders, and remove when through
steaming. For mild cases, or when child is relieved,
place saucer with tincture of benzoin near child’s
head, where fumes will be inhaled. Treat as for
cold, on following day, with counter-irritants, and use
menthol, oil nasal spray, or tincture of benzoin for
inhaling. For children subject to repeated attacks,
provide a special croup kettle.</p>

<p><em>Cough.</em> Ascertain cause from physician and treat
by his prescription. Avoid cough syrups, which are
dangerous for children. Plain honey, figs, fig juice,
are soothing. Use menthol inhaler. Apply salve of
menthol and vaseline in nose at night, and a cold compress
or mild counter-irritant on throat.</p>

<p><em>Diarrhea.</em> Stop regular food. Give infants barley
water, older children only special dietary. Give
prompt laxative. Keep in bed. Call doctor promptly
and save stools for his inspection.</p>

<p><em>Earache.</em> Symptoms in infant include crying, and
turning head from side to side. Apply counter-irritant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
behind and below ears. Place few drops of
lukewarm phenol and olive oil mixture in ear, on sterilized
cotton. Apply hot flannel, hot-water bag, or
other dry heat.</p>

<p><em>Eczema.</em> Apply salve or lotion, according to doctor’s
direction. Avoid water or vaseline on affected places,
as these are irritating. Keep clean with olive oil or
cold cream. Give dietary treatment.</p>

<p><em>Eyes Inflamed.</em> Bathe hourly with 2% boric solution
or weak salt water. For cold in eyes, also apply vaseline
at night and in morning to lids, avoiding eyes.</p>

<p><em>Headache.</em> Frequently due to constipation, indigestion,
eyestrain, excitement, fatigue, overheating.
Ascertain and treat cause. Apply cold cloths, changing
every five minutes, or hot cloths, changing every
ten minutes, or alternate hot and cold, according to
wishes of patient, to forehead and back of neck.
Apply menthol pencil to forehead and base of brain.
Massage back of neck, with strong pressure downward
and toward sides. Inhale menthol, mild camphor,
ammonia, or smelling salts.</p>

<p><em>Hiccough.</em> Due to indigestion or overeating. Hold
breath. Sip water slowly while holding breath.
Give small lump of sugar. If severe and continued,
induce sneezing or give emetic to remove cause.</p>

<p><em>Nausea.</em> Give soda mint tablet in glass of hot
water. If not relieved, give emetic. After vomiting,
give glass of hot or cold water hourly, mildly salted or
with soda mint, for several hours.</p>

<p><em>Poisoning.</em> Keep poisons out of children’s reach.
Nick cork of bottles containing poison, and tie red
ribbon around neck. Keep list of common poisons
and antidotes posted on door of medicine cabinet for
ready reference.</p>

<p><em>Prickly Heat.</em> Due to overheating from too much
clothing or from weather. Reduce quantity of clothing.
Avoid wool next the skin. Bathe several times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
a day with water 70°-80° F., adding one teaspoon baking
soda to a quart of water. Powder affected places
lightly with starch or baby powder (page 47).</p>

<p><em>Rheumatism.</em> Found in all its forms in childhood.
If chronic, may permanently injure heart. Give mild
laxative. Keep in bed. Apply dry heat as directed
to affected parts. Rub with alcohol (25% solution),
witch hazel, or arnica. Improve diet, reducing purins
and increasing alkali-forming foods. Electric treatments
may be beneficial.</p>

<p><em>Sunburn.</em> Prevent by use of canopy, sunshade, or
hat, and by applying cold cream before taking out in
sun or wind. To treat, apply cloths wet in sweet
cream, cold cream, almond lotion. Avoid use of
water on affected parts.</p>

<p><em>Fever.</em> Keep in bed. Fever is not a disease but a
symptom of poison in system. Reduce temperature
gradually. Give cool sponge (75°-80° F.) with plain
water, weak salt solution, or 25% alcohol solution, for
ten or fifteen minutes every hour. Keep cool collar of
wet cloth around neck, or on head, changing every
five minutes. In severe cases, also keep icebag at
head, hot-water bag at feet. Give abundance of cold
water, cold fruit juice with little or no sugar, or small
quantity of ice cream. Keep room cool (60°-65° F.).
There is no danger of patient taking cold while temperature
is high, but special precautions must be taken,
as fever diminishes, to prevent chilling.</p>

<p><em>Sore Throat.</em> Dissolve chlorate of potash tablet in
half pint of water, and give spoonful every half hour,
holding in mouth as long as possible. Gargle and
rinse mouth with normal salt solution, boric acid, or
listerine, without swallowing. For mild cases, apply
cold compress to throat. For severe attack, use
counter-irritant.</p>

<p><em>Stomach.</em> Sour stomach or heartburn. Use soda
mint tablet or saltspoon of baking soda in glass of hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
water. For stomach-ache give same treatment, and
massage by deep breathing and voluntary pulling in
and pushing out abdominal wall by muscular effort;
use mild trunk-bending and twisting exercises. If constipated,
give prompt laxative.</p>

<p><em>Toothache.</em> Apply listerine or oil of cloves or wintergreen
on cotton to the cavity, and dry heat or counter-irritant
outside, until dentist can be seen.</p>

<p><em>Worms.</em> Indicated by disturbed sleep, grating teeth
in sleep, picking at nose, poor or ravenous appetite,
irritation at rectum. May sometimes be visible as
fine white threads in stools. Can be accurately diagnosed
only by microscopic examination. Avoid giving
medicine except on doctor’s prescription. Reduce
candy and meat in diet.</p>

<p><b>Injuries.</b> Practice first aid until prepared to act
promptly in any ordinary emergency. Call physician
in all but mildest cases, to ascertain extent of injury,
overcome shock, and prevent poisoning. Disinfect
hands before treating any wounds.</p>

<p><em>Bruise, Bump, or Sprain.</em> Apply very cold or very
hot water, changing at proper intervals. Continue
until swelling is reduced.</p>

<p><em>Burns.</em> Never use flour or cotton on burns. Exclude
air and prevent infection from dirt or water.
Burns are easily infected or cause shock. For burns
by dry heat, apply vaseline, baking soda, carron oil,
or olive oil, and wrap in sterilized gauze to exclude air.
For scalds, apply wet cloths of cool water (sterilized
if possible), with baking soda or boric acid. Exclude
air and be careful not to break blister. Treat blisters
as burns.</p>

<p>If clothing is afire, smother by rolling on floor or
wrapping in heavy coverings. Prevent fumes and
smoke from entering lungs. If clothing is burned to
skin, cut around it and soak off with olive oil. For
fire in room, close windows and doors, and attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
smother before using water. To go through smoke,
put wet cloth over mouth and nose.</p>

<p><em>Cuts and Scratches.</em> Hold under running cool water
to thoroughly rinse out dirt. Wash with disinfectant.
Take special care with wounds from rusty instruments.
Scratches may then be painted with collodion, cuts
covered with court plaster (do not moisten in mouth)
or surgeon’s plaster.</p>

<p><em>Fall or Shock.</em> Lay flat. Apply cold water to head,
hot-water bag at heart and to feet. Cover warmly.
Rub arms and legs toward heart, without uncovering.
Apply mild smelling salts, ammonia, or camphor at
nose. Never give alcohol without doctor’s order.
Hot milk, tea, or coffee are safe stimulants.</p>

<p><em>Foreign Body in Ear.</em> Do not attempt to remove
by poking. Put in few drops of sweet oil, lay head
down on that side, till doctor comes.</p>

<p><em>Foreign Body in Nose.</em> Do not attempt to remove
by poking. Let child blow nose, closing opposite nostril.
Call doctor.</p>

<p><em>Foreign Body in Throat.</em> If not easily removed
with finger, hold child by ankles, head downward, and
slap on back. If swallowed, give soft bread at once
but do not give laxative. Remove fishbone with fingers.</p>

<p><em>Foreign Body in Eye.</em> Do not rub. Encourage
crying. Blow nose. If visible, remove with corner
of clean handkerchief. If not visible, pull upper
lid over lower, and move gently. Wash eyes with
boric or salt solution. For injury, apply cold cloths
wet in boric or salt solution.</p>

<p><em>Slivers.</em> Remove with a sterilized needle, wash with
antiseptic and bandage with zinc ointment or paint
with collodion. Never use a pin. If very difficult
to remove, apply hot fomentations.</p>

<p><b>Use of Water, Heat, and Light.</b> Heat, cold, water
and light are effective because of their action upon the
distribution of circulation, rate of metabolism, the local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
and reflex nerves, the heart action, the chemical condition
of the blood. Their therapeutic use has only in
recent years become a science. Extensive study and
experience is necessary for their efficient application.
A few fundamental principles will guide in their ordinary
use, but only a physician trained in hydrotherapy
and thermotherapy can give directions meeting
every factor in an individual case.</p>

<p>Applications affect not only the local part but also
the parts with which it is reflexly connected. The
volume of blood can be withdrawn from any part or
to any part. The first effect of hot applications is
stimulating; continued for more than ten or fifteen
minutes (after the surface is reddened) is depressing.
Cold is first depressing; continued slightly is stimulating,
and long continued becomes depressing. Alternate
heat and cold for three to ten minutes is the most
stimulating.</p>

<p>Pain, inflammation or increased secretion in any part
usually indicates local congestion of blood which needs
to be withdrawn. Congestion in the head, indicated
by headache or cold; or in the chest, indicated by
chest cold; or in the abdomen or pelvic organs, can
be reduced either by a general distribution of blood
to the surface or by withdrawing the supply to the legs
and feet. A hot bath or pack draws the supply to the
surface; a hot leg bath or pack draws it to these extremities.
The cool sponge following the hot water
keeps the blood in these parts, besides reducing the
temperature of the superheated surface and toning up
the skin. Hot fomentations draw the circulation to
the surface, away from the congested internal parts
directly beneath or reflexly connected. Thus, heat
applied to the forehead and base of brain reduces head
congestion; or as fever is usually present, cold (50° F.)
will have the same effect and at the same time reduce
the temperature, while a hot-water bag at the feet will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
maintain the temperature if the fever is mild or absent.
Congestion in the abdomen or pelvic organs is
relieved by local applications of heat to these parts
and to their reflex areas—the buttocks, thighs, feet
and hands.</p>

<p>In using heat or cold, the application must be changed
whenever its temperature approaches that of the body.
Local hot applications may be continued until the surface
is reddened—from five to twenty minutes. The
surface is then sponged quickly with water, or 25%
alcohol, at 70°-80° F., to prevent superheating of tissues.
Cold general sponging in fever may be continued ten
or fifteen minutes, one part sponged and dried at a
time, patient covered with a light blanket; and repeated
every hour. Local cold, as icebags or cold
cloths, may be continued half an hour, and repeated at
half hourly intervals. A cold compress is a mild
counter-irritant. Water reaches tissues below the
surface, and for deep-seated disorders is therefore more
effective than dry applications, when practicable. Care
must be taken to protect hair, clothing and bedding
from dampness, by use of rubber cloth or oiled silk.
For young children, temperatures must be less severe
and changes more gradual than with adults. The nurse
should test the heat of applications by applying to her
own face.</p>

<p><em>Hot Tub Bath.</em> For chills, convulsions, incipient
cold, general depression without fever. If patient is
constipated or had no movement in preceding twelve
hours, precede by enema, as hot water increases absorption
from intestinal tract. Give in warm room (70° F.),
at 100° F., or higher for children over four years. One
tablespoon mustard (in cheesecloth bag) per gallon of
water increases effect. Wrap cold cloth around neck,
and protect hair. Continue five to ten minutes, until
skin is red, adding hot water carefully to slightly raise
temperature. Give quick hand rub with water at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
80° F. unless sweating is desired. Dry quickly, wrap
and cover warmly. Giving water to drink will increase
perspiration. After perspiring, rub with 25% alcohol.</p>

<p><em>Hot Leg Bath.</em> For intestinal pain, headache, incipient
cold, cold feet, convulsions. Conditions and
temperatures as for tub bath. Keep patient well
covered. Can be given with patient lying in bed, water
in bucket on chair at side of bed. Rinse with lukewarm
water, put on stockings, and keep hot-water bag
at feet.</p>

<p><em>Hot Fomentations.</em> To relieve local pain and congestion.
Apply one or two thicknesses of flannel to
place; lay on this a double flannel wrung out of boiling
water, and cover with dry flannel and waterproof.
Be careful that it is not too hot at first. In changing,
prevent air striking part. Change every three minutes,
and continue twelve minutes. Sponge quickly with
water 70°-80° F.</p>

<p><em>Warm Tub Bath</em> (90°-93° F.). For nervousness and
irritability. May continue, maintaining temperature,
for half an hour.</p>

<p><em>Dry Heat.</em> For chills, neuralgia, rheumatic pain,
earache. Use thermophore, hot-water bottle, hot
flannel, salt, bran, hops, soapstone, flatiron wrapped in
flannel, or Japanese handstove. In using hot-water
bag, be careful it is not too hot; wrap in flannel, and
watch for leakage. Water should be below boiling or
rubber will be damaged. Press out air before putting
in stopper. Remove when cool. If electric pad is
used, turn off current when hot. Continue dry heat
for half hour periods; sponge quickly with water 80° F.;
repeat at half hour intervals if necessary.</p>

<p><em>Light.</em> Light rays penetrate about two inches below
the surface, and therefore continue the therapeutic
effects of heat to the deeper tissues. Systematic sun
baths may be given. Carbon electric light gives the
same effect; it cannot be used to advantage, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
with children under four or five years. For pain in
chest, sore throat, abdominal pain, may be used instead
of hot water or dry heat. Concentrate the light and
protect the skin from contact with bulb by a cone made
of white paper. For earache, use the smallest size bulb.
Apply for fifteen or twenty minutes, until redness is
induced, then give quick cool sponge. May be repeated
several times during day.</p>

<p><em>Cold Bath, Tub or Sponge.</em> For fever. Cool as
patient can react from, beginning at 85° and working
lower. Give several times during day, continuing ten
to fifteen minutes. Add 25% alcohol for severe cases.</p>

<p><em>Cold Compress.</em> Useful as counter-irritant and
stimulant in sore throat, cough, croup, cold in chest,
constipation. Wring cloth out of cold water (50°);
wrap on part; cover with flannel and with oiled silk or
rubber sheeting. Leave on overnight. For greater
effect, may be preceded by hot fomentation. For
throat, apply from ear to ear, bring up behind ears and
hold in place by tapes over head.</p>

<p><em>Cold Cloths for Local Congestion in Head or Back.</em>
Apply to temples, throat, base of brain, and to spine.
Change every ten minutes, or sooner if warm. For
severe congestion and pain, alternate hot and cold
cloths, changing as soon as warm.</p>

<p><b>Feeding in Illness.</b> The food is a great factor in
recovery from illness, and should be regulated with
much care. Do not urge eating. Sick animals refrain
from eating, or seek grass or special herbs. Less food
is needed when patient is in bed, except in wasting
diseases. In any illness give simple, easily digested
food, requiring minimum of chewing, providing much
nourishment with minimum of effort for patient. In
disease, provide anti-toxic diet, highly alkaline, with
little or no purins, laxative (except in intestinal disorders),
dainty, small servings, served hot, with variety
from day to day. Note all symptoms and fit dietary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
to all conditions present. It is an error to stuff a
cold, but rather it should be starved. Beef tea and
meat broths contain very little nourishment, but harmful
extractives; their stimulation is in part from extractives,
in part from the salt and heat. Hot milk,
toast-water with butter, clear vegetable broths, provide
the stimulation, with a higher percentage of
nourishment and minerals, and with none of the disadvantages
of meat broths.</p>

<p><em>Colds.</em> Reduce food almost entirely for one or two
days. Follow general diet for illness, or as for constipation.</p>

<p><em>Constipation.</em> (See page <a href="#Page_171">171</a>.) Increase oils, fruits,
and fruit juice, especially on rising and at bedtime.
Oatmeal is laxative to some children, constipating to
others. Figs, prunes, and seedless dates may be cooked
together or made into a paste. Pecan nuts, ground
for children under five, may be used for sandwiches or
with fig paste. Use olive oil and lemon juice for salad.
Serve eggs raw. Avoid foods prescribed for diarrhea.</p>

<p><em>Diarrhea.</em> Flour browned in oven lightly, then made
into gruel, cooking twenty minutes; season with salt.
Milk boiled, bread toasted; cornstarch pudding, blackberry
juice, gelatine, buttermilk made with yogurt
tablets; especially avoid purins, cellulose, raw milk,
raw eggs, as well as laxative foods.</p>

<p><em>Fever.</em> Moot question whether diet should be
limited or increased. Reduce proteins, omit purins;
provide salads, highly alkaline foods, as celery, spinach,
baked potato, cantaloupe; allow gelatine, fruit juices,
strained vegetable purées, pure ice cream, sherbets,
yogurt buttermilk, whey, toast-water.</p>

<p><em>Sore Throat.</em> Infection or from operation. Soft,
soothing, healing food. Gelatine, honey, dipped or
milk toast, fig paste, date butter, jellies, raw beaten egg,
egg and milk, blanc mange, pure ice cream. Avoid hard,
strongly acid foods, or those requiring any chewing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>

<p><em>Wasting Diseases.</em> Increase diet to patient’s capacity,
especially milk, eggs, spinach, salads, fruits, butter,
olive oil.</p>

<p><b>The Sick Room.</b> Furnishing, care, and cleaning
should be as for nursery. For a contagious disease,
disinfect room before and after patient uses. Attendant
should wear cotton dress. Street clothes should
not be allowed in sick room. Discretion should be
used regarding visitors; no one should enter in case of
contagion. Use separate bed linen and clothing for
night and day. Turn pillows frequently and change
position of patient. Use ring of cotton cloth to lift
head and prevent bedsores. Reduce room temperature
by hanging up wet sheets. Open dishes of chloride of
lime will absorb dampness. Charcoal, occasionally
changed, will absorb odors. Keep all medicines,
glasses, and food covered, room orderly and well
ventilated. In contagious diseases, attendant should
disinfect hands, gargle and rinse mouth with antiseptic
before eating; and before leaving the room, wash face
and hands with weak bichloride solution and remove
dress, cap, and shoes; a cap should cover the hair.</p>

<p><b>Bathing and Dressing.</b> The sick child should usually
have a bath twice a day, temperature and method depending
upon his condition. This removal of waste
will add to his comfort and hasten recovery. A sponge
bath is less fatiguing than the tub. A salt bath (one
third cup per gallon of water) is a tonic. It should not
be used if the skin is irritated. Bran, starch, or soda
baths relieve chafing, inflamed skin, prickly heat, irritation
in eruptive diseases. To one gallon water use
half a cup of clean bran, tied in cheesecloth and previously
soaked; or a cup of ordinary raw laundry
starch, or a tablespoon of baking soda. Alcohol
bath, using one fourth alcohol, is cooling and hardening.
Pure alcohol reduces heat too rapidly. Oil rub with
cocoa butter, or olive oil may be used for cleansing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
cold weather, for emaciation, or after bath in eruptive
diseases.</p>

<p>Rinse mouth and clean teeth after each feeding,
using boric solution, weak soda water, mild listerine
or 1% menthol solution. Disinfect brush in 70% alcohol
after using. In contagious diseases, or great
weakness, use a mouth swab, and clean teeth with
antiseptic gauze on toothpick, instead of with brush.</p>

<p><b>Maternal Nursing and Hygiene.</b> <em>Constipation.</em> Purgatives
are never to be used, and enemas employed only
as a last resort. If diet and exercise fail, cascara
sagrada or compound licorice powder may be used.</p>

<p><em>Heartburn.</em> (Acidity of the stomach.) Sometimes
develops. It may be prevented by avoiding nervousness,
by taking less fat at meals, and drinking a glass
of rich milk half an hour before mealtime; if it develops
after a meal, a soda mint tablet or a quarter of a
teaspoonful of soda bicarbonate will relieve it. The
nausea sometimes present in the first four months is
probably due to auto-intoxication from lack of elimination
of toxins. Preventive measures include careful
attention to diet, daily baths, and exercise. If it
occurs, a cup of hot water slightly salted, or a piece of
dry, hard toast taken before rising, will usually overcome
it. Peppermint, acid from grape fruit, salty food,
whole cloves held in the mouth, or a cold cloth laid
over the abdomen, are relief measures. It is rarely
present in the last four months.</p>

<p><em>Varicose Veins.</em> May be prevented by avoiding
fatigue, long standing, and by lying down several times
a day, especially after meals, for a quarter hour, with
feet elevated higher than hips. Tight bandaging or
elastic stockings must be used, if veins become varicose;
in severe cases, rest in bed is necessary.</p>

<p><em>Hemorrhoids.</em> May be prevented by avoiding constipation,
heavy exercise, overfatigue, and by lying
down a few minutes after a movement. May be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
corrected by local applications, either of cold or hot
cloths.</p>

<p><em>Pruritus.</em> Local applications of lukewarm bran
water several times a day, followed by dusting powder
made by combining one teaspoon salicylic acid with
one cup cornstarch, will relieve itching.</p>

<p><em>Hemorrhage.</em> Patient should be put to bed, hips
and legs elevated, with local applications of cold cloths
or styptic cotton. Doctor should be called immediately.</p>

<p><em>Urine.</em> Decrease in quantity (less than one quart
a day), high color, odor, or sediment, should be reported
at once to physician.</p>

<p><em>Abdomen.</em> After fourth month anoint daily with
cocoa butter or vaseline to give elasticity to skin.</p>

<p><em>Breasts.</em> During last two months wash morning and
evening with soap and warm water, drying thoroughly.
Anoint at night with cocoa butter, gently draw out
nipple. In the morning apply 25% alcohol.</p>

<p><em>Teeth.</em> Rinse mouth after each meal and at bedtime
with milk of magnesia or weak sodium bicarbonate
solution, to neutralize acids.</p>

<p><em>Childbirth.</em> Primitive women have only slight discomfort,
because of natural outdoor living and unrestricting
clothing. Minimum of pain requires well-developed
pelvis, normal position of organs, strong
abdominal muscles, previous good hygiene, moderate-sized
baby, with normal presentation. Narrow, ill-shaped
pelvis may be caused by rickets, tight
binders or diapers in infancy, or to indoor life, long
sitting, and tight clothing in girlhood, especially from
twelve to sixteen years. Abnormal position of organs
or of infant may be caused by tight clothing, heavy
clothing supported from the waist, incorrect posture,
long hours of standing during girlhood or womanhood.
Weak abdominal muscles are due to corsets and lack
of exercise. Hygiene includes regularity and rest at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
periods, freedom from excitation of the pelvic organs
during pregnancy and lactation, an interval of two or
three years between births, and a condition of reserve
vitality at the beginning of maternity. An overweight
baby is produced by overfeeding and lack of exercise
during pregnancy. Abnormal presentation may be
corrected by skilful medical care during pregnancy.
Osteopathic treatment during pregnancy, by a skilful
practitioner, may improve muscle tone.</p>

<p>The physician should be selected with special care,
either a specialist or a general practitioner with an
extensive successful obstetrical practice; and the nurse
likewise. The physician should be consulted and the
urine examined once a month until the last two months,
then fortnightly. This is necessary to prevent toxemias,
correct any abnormal position, and prepare for
any possible complications. Absolute surgical cleanliness
by physician and attendants is of the greatest
importance at birth and during confinement. Silver
nitrate solution for the baby’s eyes should not be neglected.
If there are no probabilities of complications,
if the local physician is competent and can be readily
reached, and if the home can provide sterile conditions,
strong artificial light and quiet, the home is preferable for
confinement; otherwise the hospital is better. Midwives,
unless from accredited foreign training schools,
with local licenses, and of scrupulous cleanliness, are
a dangerous investment; a competent physician is
preferable. With prenatal medical care, an experienced
physician, <em>and aseptic care</em> during confinement, it is
a very safe experience. Thoroughly satisfactory anesthetics
have not yet been discovered. With attention
to hygiene from infancy, natural means will minimize
pain.</p>

<p>Diet should be light during the first few days. Overfeeding
may cause constipation and poor milk. Rest
in bed for two weeks, and quiet life, with only light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
exercise, and chiefly out-of-doors, for the succeeding
month, is necessary for complete recovery of the pelvic
organs. A few weeks’ care and quiet at this time, even
though the mother feels strong, may prevent months or
years of invalidism. The physician should make examinations
of both mother and baby four weeks and six
weeks after birth.</p>

<p><em>Nursing.</em> The baby should be put to the breast
six to twelve hours after birth, when the mother has
rested, and every six hours for two days; thereafter,
according to schedule. This should be persisted in
for ten days, at least, the milk sometimes not coming
for a week. This is as important for the recovery of
the pelvic organs of the mother as for the nourishment
of the baby. The baby should be given water between
the feedings, but no food, unless on the doctor’s order.</p>

<p>If the baby is unable to take the breast, through
weakness or some malformation of the mouth, the milk
should be drawn out with disinfected fingers or breast
pump into a sterilized glass, and fed through a sterilized
medicine dropper, or after two months, with a spoon.</p>

<p>If the nipples become sore or cracked, a glass breast
shield with rubber nipple should be used. This is to be
boiled for five minutes after using, and kept in saturated
boric solution until needed. If the breasts are heavy,
congested, or tender, a knitted breast binder should be
worn, the breasts massaged from base toward the
center for ten minutes between nursings. If they become
caked, hot fomentations should also be applied
for fifteen minutes before massaging or nursing.</p>

<p><b>Administering Medicine.</b> Use as little medicine as
possible. When prescribed, give exactly according to
directions. Wipe mouth of bottle and examine label
carefully, before and after pouring. Use clean spoon
and disinfect after using. Remove cork with fingers,
not with teeth. Avoid getting irritating substances into
eyes or on tender, broken skin. Make a game of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
administering medicine and keep the child amiable, if
possible. When necessary, hold nose, and put spoon
back on base of tongue, to administer.</p>

sterilized bandages; 18-inch flannel squares; oiled silk, paper napkins<br>
safety pins, needles, tooth picks, handbrush, scissors<br>
</p>

<p>In case of infectious disease, lysol, creolin, or <em>fresh</em>
chloride of lime will be needed.</p>

<p><em>Emetics.</em> <em>Mild</em>: lukewarm water with teaspoon
salt. <em>Stronger</em>: tablespoon salt or teaspoon mustard
in glass lukewarm water. <em>Severe</em>: 10 to 20 drops syrup
ipecac (fresh).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<p><em>Laxatives.</em> <em>Mild</em>: mineral oil, milk of magnesia,
olive oil; one teaspoon for babies, tablespoon at six
years. For emergency, castor oil, preferably in capsule,
or between layers of orange or grape juice. For
immediate action, citrate of magnesia. For older children
or adults, compound licorice powder may be used.
Laxative oils should be given between meals; nutritive
oils shortly after meals.</p>

<p><em>Antiseptics.</em> These hinder development of germs.
For internal use and on eyes, normal salt solution (1
teaspoon salt to 1 pint water), 2% boric solution
(1 teaspoon to quart water), listerine 50%. For external
use, saturated boric solution (1 teaspoon to pint
water) listerine, 70% alcohol, witch hazel. Peroxide is
uncertain. Use tincture of green soap in warm water
for washing infected tissues. Use boiled or distilled
water in making solutions. Put in sterilized bottles.</p>

<p><em>Disinfecting.</em> Hands: scrub with hot water and
tincture of green soap or lysol, clean and trim finger
nails; for surgical cleanliness, scrub through several
waters, soak one minute in 70% alcohol, and dry on
sterilized towel. Linen from infectious patient: soak
in solution of ½ ounce creolin to two gallons water for
twelve hours before removing to laundry; boil at once.
Dishes from infectious patient: burn food; put into
covered kettle with soap powder; immediately boil
twenty minutes; or keep in patient’s room; or use
papier-maché and burn. Excreta from infectious
patient (urine, stools, vomitus): put with equal volume
of a solution made of equal parts saturated solution of
chloride of lime and 2% solution acetic acid or vinegar;
let stand quarter hour before disposing. Use tissue
napkins, squares of cheesecloth or old linen for nose
and mouth discharges. Put these and soiled dressings
into paper bag and burn at once. Room: formaldehyde
gas. Hot water and soap suds, strong sunlight,
and fresh air are disinfectants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span></p>

<p><em>Sterilizing.</em> Needle: dip in 70% alcohol, or hold in
match flame until red. Water: boil twenty minutes.
Dishes: boil twenty minutes; keep in water with vessel
covered, or in boric solution, until needed. Gauze,
bandages: boil twenty minutes in saturated boric
solution or 2% carbolic. Let cool slightly in water,
wring out with disinfected hands or in sterilized towel.
Or suspend in cheesecloth hammock tied to handles of
wash boiler. Cover tightly and steam, with water
boiling, thirty minutes. Press in sterile towel with hot
iron, leave wrapped, and keep in covered receptacle
until needed. Small squares for nursery use: cut and
tack in bundles of five before sterilizing, store in a
sterile, covered jar, and remove only as needed.</p>

<p><em>Counter-irritants.</em> These draw the circulation to the
surface, relieving internal congestion; they have not the
chemical or metabolic effect of water and light. Mild:
analgesic balm, mentholated vaseline, cold compress.
Mustard plaster is more severe. Mix one part mustard
and two parts flour, then bind together with white of
egg or <em>lukewarm</em> water. Rub lard or vaseline into
skin before applying. Leave on five to ten minutes.
If necessary, repeat in six hours, using four parts flour.
Kerosene, capsicum vaseline, red pepper, are too severe
for children. Dry mustard may be rubbed behind ears
for earache. Blistering has no value.</p>

<p>Patent medicines are expensive and dangerous.
Avoid them, especially soothing syrups, cough or worm
medicines, cold or headache cures, tonics. Many of
these contain forms of opium or of coal tar products
that affect the heart, and high per cent. of alcohol,
and are positively dangerous. Hygienic measures are
safe and more certain.</p>

<p>Choose a physician who favors hygienic treatment,
and who knows how to use physiological measures—diet,
hydrotherapy, massage, open-air treatment—with
a minimum of drugs.</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><b>Principles of Growth</b></p>

<p>Height and weight are only one index of physical
condition. They must be interpreted in connection
with other factors, as organic and muscular conditions,
appetite, energy.</p>

<p>Growth is not constant and regular but by spurts.
Increase in height and in weight usually do not proceed
together but alternate.</p>

<p>Two types of individuals are distinguished:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>a.</em> Rapid growth in height and weight until 9 to 12
years</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Slower growth 12 to 16 years</p>

<p>Early maturity (12 to 14 years, girls; 13 to 15
years, boys);</p>
</div>

<p><em>b.</em> Slow growth in height and weight until 12 to 12
years</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rapid growth after acceleration begins</p>

<p>Late maturity (14 to 16 years, girls; 15 to 18
years, boys).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Growth is influenced by various factors.</p>

<p><b>I. Heredity.</b></p>

<p>1. Race. Americans average heavier than Europeans,
and taller than Europeans except Swedish,
Danish, and Dutch. Children of Irish parentage average
taller than children of German parentage. Children
of American-born parents are in this country
taller and heavier than children of foreign-born parents.</p>

<p>2. Family. Children tend to approximate height
and build of family; good hygiene slightly increases
average above immediate ancestors.</p>

<p>3. Sex. See pages <a href="#Page_372">372-375</a>.</p>

<p><b>II. Environment and Hygiene.</b></p>

<p>1. Hygiene. Good hygiene promotes growth in
height and weight. Breastfed babies are usually
found to increase more rapidly than those artificially
fed, and this growth impulse continues through life.
See page <a href="#Page_100">100</a>.</p>

<p>A comparative study recently made of (<em>a</em>) 278
children in well-nourished families, (<em>b</em>) 1,000 orphan
asylum inmates, (<em>c</em>) 69,000 public school children,
revealed a difference of six (6) inches average height
and twenty (20) pounds average weight, at twelve
years of age, in favor of the first group, living under
good conditions of nourishment, exercise, and hygiene,
above the public-school group, the asylum group being
intermediate.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Illness retards growth, especially weight; adenoids
retard growth in height and weight.</p>

<p>2. Urban or rural environment. Country children
average taller, heavier, and greater lung capacity than
city children.</p>

<p>3. Season. In the North Temperate Zone, increase
in height is greatest from December to July, least from
June to January; growth in weight is the reverse.</p>

<p><b>Maturity.</b> Various factors influence the age of physiological
maturity.</p>

<p>1. Sex. Girls mature at from 12 to 16 years, two
years earlier than boys,—from 14 to 18 years. The
period of adjustment is longer, slower, and with less
stress and upheaval with boys than with girls.</p>

<p>2. Growth. Children above the average in height
and weight at 12 years mature earlier than those at or
below average height and weight.</p>

<p>3. Climate. Maturity is earlier in warm climates,
and later in cold climates.</p>

<p>4. Urban or rural environment. Maturity is earlier
with city children, later with country children.</p>

<p>5. Stimulation. Stimulating physical or psychical
influences, as a stimulating diet, use of alcohol, early
social dissipation, reading and plays that stimulate
sex interest, tend to cause earlier maturity.</p>

<p>Children mentally defective, retarded, or laggards
in school, are usually shorter and lighter weight and
smaller lung capacity than the median for normal
children.</p>

<p>Children above the median in height, weight, and
lung capacity (the three are usually found together)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
are usually above the average in school grades of other
children the same chronological age. Such children
may be from 1 to 5 years older physiologically and
mentally than children of the same chronological age
who are below the median in height and weight.</p>

<p><b>Proportions.</b></p>

<p>During the entire growth period the proportions of
different parts are constantly changing because of
their uneven rate of growth. The awkwardness, easy
fatigue, and weakness during childhood and adolescence
are in no small measure due to these changing
proportions and their inadequacy as compared with
their adjustment in maturity.</p>

<p>The following variations from the average are indices
of weakness, and measures should be taken for
bringing them to normal.<a id="FNanchor_50-2" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>1. Over average weight with under average height.<a id="FNanchor_50-3" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>2. Under average weight with over average height.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>3. Chest circumference less than head circumference
after two years, or less by more than one-fourth inch
under two years; or chest circumference less than the
following proportions of the body length: first year,
60%; 1 to 6 years, 56%; 6 to 9 years, 52%.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>4. Circumference of abdomen more than chest.</p>

<p>The Tables for the first five years are a composite
of the figures by Holt (compiled from several hundred
hospital and private practice cases in New York City),
the American Medical Association (compiled from
several thousand cases in 23 States), the Life Extension
Institute, and the Better Babies’ Bureau of the
Woman’s Home Companion. In the main, the minimum
figures are those of Dr. Holt, the maximum those
of the Woman’s Home Companion. The figures of
Dr. Freeman from 278 children in private practice
(see page of Charts) are from 5 to 10 per cent higher
than the maximum given in the Tables, for height and
weight.</p>

<p>All measurements are without clothing.</p>

<p>Pulse and respiration in infants may be normally
irregular and the rate greatly modified by apparently
slight causes. In very young infants regular rhythmic
breathing is seen only in sleep, and rhythm is not fully
established before two years.</p>

<p>Temperature in young children is normally 98°-99.5°F.,
taken by rectum; it occasionally rises to
100.5 in apparently perfect health. It is normally
higher in late afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_57-2" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<h3>Infant Mortality</h3>

<p>The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths
of babies which occur for every 1,000 live births.
Figures in the United States are available only for
that part of the country known as the registration
area, where the reporting of births and deaths is legally
required. It is important that the birth of every child
should be registered, and that laws requiring registration
should be enforced in every State.</p>

<p>The New York Milk Committee states that an infant
mortality rate above 50 per 1,000 is preventable by
sanitation, hygiene, prenatal care, and the instruction
of mothers; and that a rate beyond this is unfair to
the babies, and a disgrace to the community for its
negligence.</p>

<p>The death rate is higher during the first five years
than at any other five-year period; higher during the
first year than any other year; highest during the first
month; and its maximum is during the first week of
life.</p>

<p>It is estimated that about fifty per cent. of all children
die before they are born. Life is conferred at conception,
and miscarriage is really death before birth. The
registration of stillbirths, with causes, should be required
by law, as it now is in some foreign countries.</p>

causes in summer; pneumonia and colds in winter.</p>

<p>Most of these deaths were due to preventable causes.</p>

<p>Even with these preventable deaths, the chances of
death in childbirth were only 1 in about 200 births.</p>

<p>In every community where instruction has been provided
in prenatal hygiene and the care of infants, a
marked reduction has resulted, both in prenatal deaths,
in mortality in pregnancy, in infant mortality and in
the inability of mothers to nurse their babies.</p>

of space.</p>

<p>It is usually impossible to say that any one book is
the best on its subject. One book will be better than
another for individual readers, according to their individual
experience, training, environment, and problems.
In the main, the publications listed are of approximately
the same caliber as the present Manual.
In the list of periodicals, note is made of those that are
official publications of organizations. By including
in the description of each book the year of publication,
number of pages, price, and whether illustrated, the
reader has some further clue to its character. Books
including a bibliography are usually more systematic
and scientific than those without such a list. The
dates given are those of latest edition or translations,
to 1916. Prices quoted are net, and do not include
transportation.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
